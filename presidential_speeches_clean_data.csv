This momentous decree came as a greatbeacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames ofwithering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of theircaptivity.But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. Onehundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles ofsegregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on alonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundredyears later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and findshimself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shamefulcondition.In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check.When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution andthe Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which everyAmerican was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well aswhite men, would be guaranteed the unalienable Rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofaras her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation,America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back markedinsufficient funds.But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. Werefuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity ofthis nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demandthe riches of freedom and the security of justice.We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of thefierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to takethe tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises ofdemocracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to thesunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands ofracial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice areality for all of God's children.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of themoment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass untilthere is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not anend, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will nowbe content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted hiscitizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of ournation until the bright day of justice emerges.But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on thewarm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining ourrightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy ourthirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conductour struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creativeprotest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majesticheights of meeting physical force with soul force.The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro communitymust not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, asevidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied upwith our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably boundto our freedom. We cannot walk alone.And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always marchahead.We cannot turn back.There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights,When will you be satisfied? We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro isthe victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied aslong as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels ofthe highways and the hotels of the cities. *We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: For Whites Only.* We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro inMississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down likewaters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.å_I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of greattrials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of youhave come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms ofpersecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans ofcreative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia,go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowingthat somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley ofdespair, I say to you today, my friends.And so even though we face the difficulties oftoday and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the Americandream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live outthe true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men arecreated equal.I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons offormer slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at thetable of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a statesweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will betransformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in anation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content oftheir character. I have a dream today!I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with itsvicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words ofinterposition and nullification -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and blackgirls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters andbrothers.I have a dream today!I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and everyhill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all fleshshall see it together.2This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the Southwith.With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone ofhope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nationinto a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to worktogether, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up forfreedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride,From every mountainside, let freedom ring! And ifAmerica is to be a great nation, this must become true.And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies ofPennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.But not only that:Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.From every mountainside, let freedom ring.And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring,when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city,we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men andwhite men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands andsing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:Free at last! Free at last!Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!3* = text within asterisks absent from the above audio but verified as originally  deliveredå_Amos 5:24 (rendered precisely in The American Standard Version of the Holy Bible)2 Isaiah 40:4-5 (King James Version of the Holy Bible).

(2)][Taking the oath of Office]Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, PresidentEisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, reverend clergy, fellow citizens:We observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom -- symbolizing an end,as well as a beginning -- signifying renewal, as well as change. For I have sworn before youand Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century andthree-quarters ago.The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal handsthe power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet thesame revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around theglobe -- the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, butfrom the hand of God.We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that firstrevolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, thatthe torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans -- born in this century,tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage,and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which thisnation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and aroundthe world.Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bearany burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survivaland the success of liberty.This much we pledge -- and more.To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyaltyof faithful friends. United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperativeventures. Divided there is little we can do -- for we dare not meet a powerful challenge atodds and split asunder.To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, wepledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to bereplaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supportingour view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom --and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back ofthe tiger ended up inside.To those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bondsof mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whateverperiod is required -- not because the Communists may be doing it, not because we seektheir votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot savethe few who are rich.To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a specialpledge: to convert our good words into good deeds, in a new alliance for progress, toassist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But thispeaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all ourneighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere inthe Americas. And let every other power know that this hemisphere intends toremain the master of its own house.To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, ourlast best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments ofpeace, we renew our pledge of support -- to prevent it from becoming merely a forum forinvective, to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak, and to enlarge the area inwhich its writ may run.Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledgebut a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers ofdestruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidentalself-destruction.We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubtcan we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.But neither can two greatand powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course -- both sidesoverburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread ofthe deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays thehand of mankind's final war.So let us begin anew -- remembering on both sides thatcivility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear tonegotiate.Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems whichdivide us.Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for theinspection and control of arms, and bring the absolute power to destroy other nationsunder the absolute control of all nations.Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together letus explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, andencourage the arts and commerce.Let both sides unite to heed, in all corners of the earth, the command of Isaiah -- toundo the heavy burdens, and [to] let the oppressed go free.å_And, if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sidesjoin in creating a new endeavor -- not a new balance of power, but a new world of law --where the strong are just, and the weak secure, and the peace preserved.All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished inthe first one thousand days; nor in the life of this Administration; nor even perhaps inour lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failureof our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has beensummoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans whoanswered the call to service surround the globe.Now the trumpet summons us again -- not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need -- notas a call to battle, though embattled we are -- but a call to bear the burden of a longtwilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation,å_ astruggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance,North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Willyou join in that historic effort?In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role ofdefending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility-- I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any otherpeople or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to thisendeavor will light our country and all who serve it. And the glow from that fire cantruly light the world.And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can dofor your country.My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America will do for you, but what togetherwe can do for the freedom of man.Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of theworld, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask ofyou. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the finaljudge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and Hishelp, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.Book/CDs by Michael E.

(2)]President Hoover, Mr. Chief Justice, my friends: This is a day of national consecration. And I am certain that on this day my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency, I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our people impels.This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure, as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself -- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life, a leadership of frankness and of vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. And I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunk to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; and the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone. More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.And yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered, because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply.Primarily, this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.True, they have tried. But their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit, they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They only know the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish.Yes, the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of that restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy, the moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days, my friends, will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves, to our fellow men.Recognition of that falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, and on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live.Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This Nation is asking for action, and action now.Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing great -- greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our great natural resources.Hand in hand with that we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land.Yes, the task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products, and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities. It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by insistence that the Federal, the State, and the local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, unequal. It can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities that have a definitely public character. There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped by merely talking about it.We must act. We must act quickly.And finally, in our progress towards a resumption of work, we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order. There must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments. There must be an end to speculation with other people's money. And there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.These, my friends, are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new Congress in special session detailed measures for their fulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the 48 States.Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo. Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of time, and necessity, secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy. I favor, as a practical policy, the putting of first things first. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment; but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment.The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not nationally -- narrowly nationalistic. It is the insistence, as a first consideration, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the United States of America -- a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the pioneer. It is the way to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest assurance that recovery will endure.In the field of world policy, I would dedicate this Nation to the policy of the good neighbor: the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others; the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors.If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize, as we have never realized before, our interdependence on each other; that we can not merely take, but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress can be made, no leadership becomes effective.We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and our property to such discipline, because it makes possible a leadership which aims at the larger good. This, I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us, bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in times of armed strife.With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems.Action in this image, action to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution is so simple, so practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form. That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has ever seen.It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations. And it is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly equal, wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure.I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require. These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption.But, in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses, in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis -- broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.For the trust reposed in me, I will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time. I can do no less.We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity; with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values; with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the assurance of a rounded, a permanent national life.We do not distrust the -- the future of essential democracy. The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it.In this dedication -- In this dedication of a Nation, we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and every one of us.May He guide me in the days to come.  Book/CDs by Michael E.

(2)]Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate, and of theHouse of Representatives:Yesterday, December 7th, 1941 -- a date which will live in infamy --the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and airforces of the Empire of Japan.The United States was at peace with that nation and, at thesolicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its emperorlooking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific.Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombingin the American island of Oahu, the Japanese ambassador to the United States and hiscolleague  delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent Americanmessage. And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existingdiplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack.It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes itobvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During theintervening time, the Japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the UnitedStates by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian islands has caused severedamage to American naval and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many Americanlives have been lost. In addition, American ships have been reported torpedoed on the highseas between San Francisco and Honolulu.Yesterday, the Japanese government also launched an attack againstMalaya.Last night, Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong.Last night, Japanese forces attacked Guam.Last night, Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands.Last night, the Japanese attacked Wake Island.And this morning, the Japanese attacked Midway Island.Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extendingthroughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. Thepeople of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand theimplications to the very life and safety of our nation.As Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that allmeasures be taken for our defense. But always will our whole nation remember the characterof the onslaught against us.No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditatedinvasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolutevictory.I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of thepeople when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but willmake it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people,our territory, and our interests are in grave danger.With confidence in our armed forces, with the unboundingdetermination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph -- so help us God.I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked anddastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, a state of war has existedbetween the United States and the Japanese empire.Book/CDs by Michael E.

But there is something differentabout tonight. There is something special about tonight. What is different?What is special? I, Barbara Jordan, am a keynote speaker.When -- A lot of years passed since 1832, and during that time it would havebeen most unusual for any national political party to ask a BarbaraJordan to deliver a keynote address. But tonight, here I am. And I feel -- I feel thatnotwithstanding the past that my presence here is one additional bit ofevidence that the American Dream need not forever be deferred.Now -- Now that I have this grand distinction, what in the world am I supposedto say? I could easily spend this time praising the accomplishments ofthis party and attacking the Republicans -- but I don't choose to do that.I could list the many problems which Americans have. I could list the problemswhich cause people to feel cynical, angry, frustrated: problems which includelack of integrity in government; the feeling that the individual no longercounts; the reality of material and spiritual poverty; the feeling thatthe grand American experiment is failing or has failed. I could recitethese problems, and then I could sit down and offer no solutions. But Idon't choose to do that either. The citizens of America expect more. Theydeserve and they want more than a recital of problems.We are a people in a quandary about the present. We are a people insearch of our future. We are a people in search of a national community.We are a people trying not only to solve the problems of the present, unemployment,inflation, but we are attempting on a larger scale to fulfill the promiseof America. We are attempting to fulfill our national purpose, to create and sustain a society in which all of us are equal.Throughout -- Throughout our history, when people have looked for new ways to solve their problems and to uphold the principles of this nation, many times they have turned to political parties. They have often turned to the Democratic Party. What is it? What is it about the Democratic Party that makes it the instrument the people use when they search for ways to shape their future? Well I believe the answer to that question lies in our concept of governing. Our concept of governing is derived from our view of people. It is a concept deeply rooted in a set of beliefs firmly etched in the national conscience of all of us.Now what are these beliefs? First, we believe in equality for all andprivileges for none. This is a belief -- This is a belief that each American, regardless ofbackground, has equal standing in the public forum -- all of us. Because -- Because webelieve this idea so firmly, we are an inclusive rather than an exclusiveparty. Let everybody come.I think it no accident that most of those immigratingto America in the 19th century identified with the Democratic Party. Weare a heterogeneous party made up of Americans of diverse backgrounds.We believe that the people are the source of all governmental power; that the authority of the people is to be extended, not restricted.This -- This can be accomplished only by providing each citizen with every opportunity to participate in the management of the government. They must have that, we believe. We believe that the government which represents the authority of all the people, not just one interest group, but all the people, has an obligation to actively -- underscore actively -- seek to remove those obstacles which would block individual achievement -- obstacles emanating from race, sex, economic condition. The government must remove them, seek to remove them. We.We are a party -- We are a party of innovation. We do not reject our traditions, but we are willing to adapt to changing circumstances, when change we must. We are willing to suffer the discomfort of change in order to achieve a better future. We have a positive vision of the future founded on the belief that the gap between the promise and reality of America can one day be finally closed. We believe that.This, my friends is the bedrock of our concept of governing. This isa part of the reason why Americans have turned to the Democratic Party.These are the foundations upon which a national community can be built. Let all understand that these guiding principles cannot be discardedfor short-term political gains. They represent what this country is allabout. They are indigenous to the American idea. And these are principleswhich are not negotiable.In other times -- In other times, I could stand here and give this kind of expositionon the beliefs of the Democratic Party and that would be enough. But todaythat is not enough. People want more. That is not sufficient reason forthe majority of the people of this country to decide to vote Democratic. We havemade mistakes. We realize that. We admit our mistakes. In our haste to do all things for all people, we did not foresee the full consequences of our actions. And when the people raised their voices, we didn't hear. But our deafness was only a temporary condition, and not an irreversible condition.Even as I stand here and admit that we have made mistakes, I still believe that as the people of America sit in judgment on each party, they will recognize that our mistakes were mistakes of the heart. They'll recognize that.And now -- now we must look to the future. Let us heed the voice of the peopleand recognize their common sense. If we do not, we not only blaspheme ourpolitical heritage, we ignore the common ties that bind all Americans.Many fear the future. Many are distrustful of their leaders, and believethat their voices are never heard. Many seek only to satisfy their privatework -- wants; to satisfy their private interests. But this is the great dangerAmerica faces -- that we will cease to be one nation and become instead acollection of interest groups: city against suburb, region against region,individual against individual; each seeking to satisfy private wants. Ifthat happens, who then will speak for America? Who then will speak for the common good?This is the question which must be answered in 1976: Are we to be one people bound together by common spirit, sharing in acommon endeavor; or will we become a divided nation? For all of its uncertainty,we cannot flee the future. We must not become the New Puritans and rejectour society. We must address and master the future together. It can bedone if we restore the belief that we share a sense of national community,that we share a common national endeavor. It can be done.There is no executive order; there is no law that can require the Americanpeople to form a national community. This we must do as individuals, and if we do it as individuals, there is no President of the United States who can veto that decision.As a first step -- As a first step, we must restore our belief in ourselves. We are a generous people, so why can't we be generous with each other? Weneed to take to heart the words spoken by Thomas Jefferson:Let us restore the social intercourse -- Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony andthat affection without which liberty and even life are but drearythings.A nation is formed by the willingness of each of us to share in theresponsibility for upholding the common good. A government is invigoratedwhen each one of us is willing to participate in shaping the future ofthis nation. In this election year, we must define the common good and beginagain to shape a  common future.Let each person do his or her part. If one citizen is unwilling to participate,all of us are going to suffer. For the American idea, though it is sharedby all of us, is realized in each one of us.And now, what are those of us who are elected public officials supposedto do? We call ourselves public servants but I'll tell you this: We aspublic servants must set an example for the rest of the nation. It is hypocriticalfor the public official to admonish and exhort the people to uphold thecommon good if we are derelict in upholding the common good. More is required -- More is required of public officials than slogans and handshakesand press releases. More is required. We must hold ourselves strictly accountable.We must provide the people with a vision of the future.If we promise as public officials, we must deliver. If -- If we as publicofficials propose, we must produce. If we say to the American people, Itis time for you to be sacrificial -- sacrifice. If the public official says that, we [public officials] must be the first to give. We must be. Andagain, if we make mistakes, we must be willing to admit them. We have todo that. What we have to do is strike a balance between the idea that government should do everything and the idea, the belief, that government ought to do nothing. Strike a balance.Let there be no illusions about the difficulty of forming this kindof a national community. It's tough, difficult, not easy. But a spiritof harmony will survive in America only if each of us remembers that weshare a common destiny; if each of us remembers, when self-interest and bitterness seem to prevail, that we share a common destiny.I have confidence that we can form this kind of national community.I have confidence that the Democratic Party can lead the way.I have that confidence.We cannot improve on the system of government handed down to us by thefounders of the Republic. There is no way to improve upon that. But whatwe can do is to find new ways to implement that system and realize ourdestiny.Now I began this speech by commenting to you on the uniqueness of aBarbara Jordan making a keynote address. Well I am going to close myspeech by quoting a Republican President and I ask you that as you listento these words of Abraham Lincoln, relate them to the concept of a nationalcommunity in which every last one of us participates:As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This -- This -- This expresses my idea of Democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no Democracy.Thank you.Book/CDs by Michael E.

NixonCheckers delivered and broadcast live on television 23 September 1952Video Purchase  );  "", ""//web2.millercenter.org/speeches/audio/spe_1952_0923_nixon."");   ; for flashMy Fellow Americans, I come before you tonight as a candidate for the Vice Presidency andas a man whose honesty and -- and integrity has been questioned.Now, the usual political thing to do when charges are made against youis to either ignore them or to deny them without giving details. I believewe've had enough of that in the United States, particularly with the presentAdministration in Washington, D.C.To me the office of the Vice Presidencyof the United States is a great office, and I feel that the people havegot to have confidence in the integrity of the men who run for that officeand who might obtain it.I have a theory, too, that the best and only answer to a smear or toan honest misunderstanding of the facts is to tell the truth. And that'swhy I'm here tonight. I want to tell you my side of the case. I'm surethat you have read the charge, and you've heard it, that I, Senator Nixon,took 18,000 dollars from a group of my supporters.Now, was that wrong? And let me say that it was wrong. I'm saying,incidentally, that it was wrong, not just illegal, because it isn't a questionof whether it was legal or illegal, that isn't enough. The question is,was it morally wrong? I say that it was morally wrong -- if any of that18,000 dollars went to Senator Nixon, for my personal use. I say that it was morallywrong if it was secretly given and secretly handled. And I say that itwas morally wrong if any of the contributors got special favors for thecontributions that they made.And now to answer those questions let me say this: Not one cent of the18,000 dollars or any other money of that type ever went to me for my personaluse. Every penny of it was used to pay for political expenses that I didnot think should be charged to the taxpayers of the United States.It was not a secret fund. As a matter of fact, when I was on ""Meetthe Press"" -- some of you may have seen it last Sunday -- Peter Edson cameup to me after the program, and he said, ""Dick, what about this fund we hearabout?"" And I said, ""Well, there's no secret about it. Go out and seeDana Smith who was the administrator of the fund."" And I gave him [Edson]his [Smith's] address. And I said you will find that the purpose of thefund simply was to defray political expenses that I did not feel shouldbe charged to the Government.And third, let me point out -- and I wantto make this particularly clear -- that no contributor to this fund, nocontributor to any of my campaigns, has ever received any considerationthat he would not have received as an ordinary constituent. I just don't believe in that, and I can say that never, while I havebeen in the Senate of the United States, as far as the people that contributedto this fund are concerned, have I made a telephone call for them to anagency, or have I gone down to an agency in their behalf. And the recordswill show that, the records which are in the hands of the administration.Well, then, some of you will say, and rightly, Well, what did you use the fund for, Senator? Why did you have to have it?"" Let me tell you injust a word how a Senate office operates. First of all, a Senator gets15,000 dollars a year in salary. He gets enough money to pay for one trip a year --a round trip, that is -- for himself and his family between his home andWashington, D.C. And then he gets an allowance to handle the people thatwork in his office to handle his mail. And the allowance for my State ofCalifornia is enough to hire 13 people. And let me say, incidentally,that that allowance is not paid to the Senator. It's paid directly tothe individuals that the Senator puts on his pay roll. But all of thesepeople and all of these allowances are for strictly official business;business, for example, when a constituent writes in and wants you to godown to the Veteran's Administration and get some information about hisGI policy -- items of that type, for example. But there are other expenses which are not covered by the Government. AndI think I can best discuss those expenses by asking you some questions.Do you think that when I or any other Senator makes a political speech,has it printed, should charge the printing of that speech and the mailingof that speech to the taxpayers? Do you think, for example, when I or anyother Senator makes a trip to his home State to make a purely politicalspeech that the cost of that trip should be charged to the taxpayers? Doyou think when a Senator makes political broadcasts or political televisionbroadcasts, radio or television, that the expense of those broadcasts shouldbe charged to the taxpayers? Well I know what your answer is. It's thesame answer that audiences give me whenever I discuss this particular problem:The answer is no. The taxpayers shouldn't be required to finance itemswhich are not official business but which are primarily political business.Well, then the question arises, you say, ""Well, how do you pay for theseand how can you do it legally?"" And there are several ways that it canbe done, incidentally, and that it is done legally in the United States Senateand in the Congress. The first way is to be a rich man. I don't happento be a rich man, so I couldn't use that one. Another way that is usedis to put your wife on the pay roll. Let me say, incidentally, that myopponent, my opposite number for the Vice Presidency on the Democraticticket, does have his wife on the pay roll and has had it -- her on his pay rollfor the ten years -- for the past ten years. Now just let me say this: That's his business, andI'm not critical of him for doing that. You will have to pass judgmenton that particular point.But I have never done that for this reason: I have found that thereare so many deserving stenographers and secretaries in Washington thatneeded the work that I just didn't feel it was right to put my wife onthe pay roll. My wife's sitting over here. She's a wonderful stenographer.She used to teach stenography and she used to teach shorthand in high school.That was when I met her. And I can tell you folks that she's worked manyhours at night and many hours on Saturdays and Sundays in my office, andshe's done a fine job, and I am proud to say tonight that in the six yearsI've been in the House and the Senate of the United States, Pat Nixonhas never been on the Government pay roll.What are other ways that these finances can be taken care of? Some whoare lawyers, and I happen to be a lawyer, continue to practice law, butI haven't been able to do that. I'm so far away from California that I've been so busy with my senatorial work that I have not engaged in anylegal practice. And, also, as far as law practice is concerned, it seemedto me that the relationship between an attorney and the client was so personalthat you couldn't possibly represent a man as an attorney and then havean unbiased view when he presented his case to you in the event that hehad one before Government.And so I felt that the best way to handle these necessary politicalexpenses of getting my message to the American people and the speechesI made -- the speeches that I had printed for the most part concerned this onemessage of exposing this Administration, the Communism in it, the corruptionin it -- the only way that I could do that was to accept the aid whichpeople in my home State of California, who contributed to my campaign andwho continued to make these contributions after I was elected, were gladto make.And let me say I'm proud of the fact that not one of them has everasked me for a special favor. I'm proud of the fact that not one of themhas ever asked me to vote on a bill other than of my own conscience woulddictate. And I am proud of the fact that the taxpayers, by subterfuge orotherwise, have never paid one dime for expenses which I thought were politicaland shouldn't be charged to the taxpayers.Let me say, incidentally, that some of you may say, ""Well, that's allright, Senator, that's your explanation, but have you got any proof?"" AndI'd like to tell you this evening that just an hour ago we received anindependent audit of this entire fund. I suggested to Governor ShermanAdams, who is the Chief of Staff of the Dwight Eisenhower campaign, thatan independent audit and legal report be obtained, and I have that audithere in my hands. It's an audit made by the Price Waterhouse &amp; Company firm,and the legal opinion by Gibson, Dunn, &amp; Crutcher, lawyers in Los Angeles,the biggest law firm, and incidentally, one of the best ones in Los Angeles.I am proud to be able to report to you tonight that this audit and this legal opinion is being forwarded to General Eisenhower. And I'd like to read to you the opinion that was prepared by Gibson, Dunn, &amp; Crutcher, and based on all the pertinent laws and statutes, together with the audit report prepared by the certified public accountants. Quote:It is our conclusionthat Senator Nixon did not obtain any financial gain from the collectionand disbursement of the fund by Dana Smith;that Senator Nixon did not violate any federal or state law by reason ofthe operation of the fund; and that neitherthe portion of the fund paid by Dana Smith directly to third persons, northe portion paid to Senator Nixon, to reimburse himfor designated office expenses, constituted income to the Senator whichwas either reportable or taxable as income under applicabletax laws. (signed) Gibson, Dunn,&amp; Crutcher, by Elmo H. ConleyNow that, my friends, is not Nixon speaking, but that's an independentaudit which was requested, because I want the American people to know allthe facts, and I am not afraid of having independent people go in and check the facts, and that is exactly what they did. But then I realized that there are still some who may say, and rightfully so -- and let me say that I recognize that some will continueto smear regardless of what the truth may be -- but that there has been,understandably, some honest misunderstanding on this matter, and thereare some that will say, ""Well, maybe you were able, Senator, to fake thisthing. How can we believe what you say? After all, is there a possibilitythat maybe you got some sums in cash? Is there a possibility that you mayhave feathered your own nest?"" And so now, what I am going to do -- andincidentally this is unprecedented in the history of American politics-- I am going at this time to give to this television and radio audio -- audience,a complete financial history, everything I've earned, everything I've spent,everything I own. And I want you to know the facts.I'll have to start early. I was born in 1913. Our family was one ofmodest circumstances, and most of my early life was spent in a store outin East Whittier. It was a grocery store, one of those family enterprises.The only reason we were able to make it go was because my mother and dadhad five boys, and we all worked in the store. I worked my way throughcollege, and, to a great extent, through law school. And then in 1940,probably the best thing that ever happened to me happened. I married Patwho's sitting over here. We had a rather difficult time after we weremarried, like so many of the young couples who may be listening to us.I practiced law. She continued to teach school.Then, in 1942, I went into the service. Let me say that my service recordwas not a particularly unusual one. I went to the South Pacific. I guessI'm entitled to a couple of battle stars. I got a couple of letters ofcommendation. But I was just there when the bombs were falling. And thenI returned -- returned to the United States, and in 1946, I ran for theCongress. When we came out of the war -- Pat and I -- Pat during the warhad worked as a stenographer, and in a bank, and as an economist for aGovernment agency -- and when we came out, the total of our savings, fromboth my law practice, her teaching and all the time that I was in the war, thetotal for that entire period was just a little less than 10,000 dollars. Everycent of that, incidentally, was in Government bonds. Well that's wherewe start, when I go into politics.Now, what have I earned since I went into politics? Well, here it is.I've jotted it down. Let me read the notes. First of all, I've had mysalary as a Congressman and as a Senator. Second, I have received a totalin this past six years of 1600 dollars from estates which were in my law firmat the time that I severed my connection with it. And, incidentally, asI said before, I have not engaged in any legal practice and have not acceptedany fees from business that came into the firm after I went into politics.I have made an average of approximately 1500 dollars a year from nonpoliticalspeaking engagements and lectures.And then, fortunately, we've inherited a little money. Pat sold herinterest in her father's estate for 3,000 dollars, and I inherited 1500 dollars frommy grandfather. We lived rather modestly. For four years we lived in anapartment in Parkfairfax, in Alexandria, Virginia. The rent was 80 dollars amonth. And we saved for the time that we could buy a house. Now, that waswhat we took in. What did we do with this money? What do we have todayto show for it? This will surprise you because it is so little, I suppose,as standards generally go of people in public life.First of all, we've got a house in Washington, which cost 41,000 dollars andon which we owe 20,000 dollars. We have a house in Whittier, California whichcost 13,000 dollars and on which we owe 3000 dollars. My folks are living there at thepresent time. I have just 4000 dollars in life insurance, plus my GI policy whichI've never been able to convert, and which will run out in two years. Ihave no life insurance whatever on Pat. I have no life insurance on ourtwo youngsters, Tricia and Julie. I own a 1950 Oldsmobile car. We have ourfurniture. We have no stocks and bonds of any type. We have no interestof any kind, direct or indirect, in any business. Now, that's what we have.What do we owe?Well in addition to the mortgage, the 20,000 dollar mortgage on the housein Washington, the 10,000 dollar one on the house in Whittier, I owe 4500 dollars tothe Riggs Bank in Washington, D.C., with interest 4 and 1/2 percent. Iowe 3500 dollars to my parents, and the interest on that loan, which I pay regularly,because it's the part of the savings they made through the years they wereworking so hard -- I pay regularly 4 percent interest. And then I havea 500 dollar loan, which I have on my life insurance.Well, that's about it. That's what we have. And that's what we owe.It isn't very much. But Pat and I have the satisfaction that every dimethat we've got is honestly ours. I should say this, that Pat doesn't havea mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat, andI always tell her she'd look good in anything.One other thing I probably should tell you, because if I don't they'llprobably be saying this about me, too. We did get something, a gift, afterthe election. A man down in Texas heard Pat on the radio mention the factthat our two youngsters would like to have a dog. And believe it or not,the day before we left on this campaign trip we got a message from UnionStation in Baltimore, saying they had a package for us. We went down toget it. You know what it was? It was a little cocker spaniel dog in acrate that he'd sent all the way from Texas, black and white, spotted. And our little girl Tricia, the six year old, named it Checkers. And you know, the kids, like all kids, love the dog, and I just wantto say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we'regonna keep it.It isn't easy to come before a nationwide audience and bare your life,as I've done. But I want to say some things before I conclude that I thinkmost of you will agree on. Mr. Mitchell, the Chairman of the DemocraticNational Committee, made this statement -- that if a man couldn't afford tobe in the United States Senate, he shouldn't run for the Senate. And Ijust want to make my position clear. I don't agree with Mr. Mitchell whenhe says that only a rich man should serve his Government in the UnitedStates Senate or in the Congress. I don't believe that represents the thinkingof the Democratic Party, and I know that it doesn't represent the thinkingof the Republican Party.I believe that it's fine that a man like Governor Stevenson, who inheriteda fortune from his father, can run for President. But I also feel thatit's essential in this country of ours that a man of modest means can alsorun for President, because, you know, remember Abraham Lincoln, you rememberwhat he said: ""God must have loved the common people -- he made so manyof them.""And now I'm going to suggest some courses of conduct. First of all,you have read in the papers about other funds, now. Mr. Stevenson apparentlyhad a couple -- one of them in which a group of business people paid andhelped to supplement the salaries of State employees. Here is where themoney went directly into their pockets, and I think that what Mr. Stevensonshould do should be to come before the American people, as I have, givethe names of the people that contributed to that fund, give the names ofthe people who put this money into their pockets at the same time thatthey were receiving money from their State government and see what favors,if any, they gave out for that.I don't condemn Mr. Stevenson for what he did, but until the facts arein there is a doubt that will be raised. And as far as Mr. Sparkman isconcerned, I would suggest the same thing. He's had his wife on the payroll. I don't condemn him for that, but I think that he should come beforethe American people and indicate what outside sources of income he hashad. I would suggest that under the circumstances both Mr. Sparkman andMr. Stevenson should come before theAmerican people, as I have, and make a complete financial statement asto their financial history, and if they don't it will be an admission thatthey have something to hide. And I think you will agree with me -- because,folks, remember, a man that's to be President of the United States, a manthat's to be Vice President of the United States, must have the confidenceof all the people. And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing. And that'swhy I suggest that Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Sparkman, since they are underattack, should do what they're doing.Now let me say this: I know that this is not the last of the smears.In spite of my explanation tonight, other smears will be made. Others havebeen made in the past. And the purpose of the smears, I know, is this:to silence me; to make me let up. Well, they just don't know who they'redealing with. I'm going to tell you this: I remember in the dark days ofthe Hiss case some of the same columnists, some of the same radio commentatorswho are attacking me now and misrepresenting my position, were violently opposing me at the time I was after AlgerHiss. But I continued to fight because I knew I was right, and I can sayto this great television and radio audience that I have no apologies tothe American people for my part in putting Alger Hiss where he is today.And as far as this is concerned, I intend to continue to fight.Why do I feel so deeply? Why do I feel that in spite of the smears,the misunderstanding, the necessity for a man to come up here and barehis soul as I have -- why is it necessary for me to continue this fight?And I want to tell you why. Because, you see, I love my country. And Ithink my country is in danger. And I think the only man that can save Americaat this time is the man that's running for President, on my ticket -- DwightEisenhower. You say, ""Why do I think it is in danger?"" And I say, lookat the record. Seven years of the Truman-Acheson Administration, and what'shappened? Six hundred million people lost to the Communists. And a war in Koreain which we have lost 117,000 American casualties, and I say to all ofyou that a policy that results in the loss of 600 million people to theCommunists, and a war which cost us 117,000 American casualties isn't goodenough for America. And I say that those in the State Departmentthat made the mistakes which caused that war and which resulted in thoselosses should be kicked out of the State Department just as fast as weget them out of there.And let me say that I know Mr. Stevenson won't do that because he defendsthe Truman policy, and I know that Dwight Eisenhower will do that, andthat he will give America the leadership that it needs. Take the problemof corruption. You've read about the mess in Washington. Mr. Stevensoncan't clean it up because he was picked by the man, Truman, under whose Administration the messwas made. You wouldn't trust the man who made the mess to clean it up. That'sTruman. And by the same token you can't trust the man who was picked bythe man that made the mess to clean it up -- and that's Stevenson.And so Isay, Eisenhower, who owed nothing to Truman, nothing to the big city bosses-- he is the man that can clean up the mess in Washington. Take Communism.I say that as far as that subject is concerned the danger is great to America.In the Hiss case they got the secrets which enabled them to break the Americansecret State Department code. They got secrets in the atomic bomb casewhich enabled them to get the secret of the atomic bomb five years beforethey would have gotten it by their own devices. And I say that any manwho called the Alger Hiss case a red herring isn't fit to be Presidentof the United States. I say that a man who, like Mr. Stevenson, has pooh-poohed and ridiculedthe Communist threat in the United States -- he said that they are phantomsamong ourselves. He has accused us that have attempted to expose the Communists,of looking for Communists in the Bureau of Fisheries and Wildlife. I saythat a man who says that isn't qualified to be President of theUnited States. And I say that the only man who can lead us in this fightto rid the Government of both those who are Communists and those who havecorrupted this Government is Eisenhower, because Eisenhower, you can besure, recognizes the problem, and he knows how to deal with it.Now let me that finally, this evening, I want to read to you, just briefly, excerpts from a letter which I received, a letter which after all this is over no one can take away from us. It reads as follows:Dear SenatorNixon, Since I amonly 19 years of age, I can't vote in this presidential election, but believeme if I could you and General Eisenhowerwould certainly get my vote. My husband is in the Fleet Marines in Korea.He' a corpsman on the front lines and we have a two month old son he's never seen. And I feel confident that with great Americanslike you and General Eisenhower in the White House, lonely Americans like myself will be united with their loved ones now in Korea. I only pray to God that you won't be too late. Enclosed is a small check to help you in your campaign. Living on $85 a month, it is all I can afford at present, but let me know what else I can do.Folks, it's a check for 10 dollars, and it's one that I will never cash. Andjust let me say this: We hear a lot about prosperity these days, but Isay why can't we have prosperity built on peace, rather than prosperitybuilt on war? Why can't we have prosperity and an honest Government inWashington, D.C., at the same time? Believe me, we can. And Eisenhoweris the man that can lead this crusade to bring us that kind of prosperity.And now, finally, I know that you wonder whether or not I am going tostay on the Republican ticket or resign. Let me say this: I don't believethat I ought to quit, because I am not a quitter. And, incidentally, Pat'snot a quitter. After all, her name was Patricia Ryan and she was born onSt. Patrick's day, and you know the Irish never quit. But the decision,my friends, is not mine. I would do nothing that would harm the possibilitiesof Dwight Eisenhower to become President of the United States. And forthat reason I am submitting to the Republican National Committee tonightthrough this television broadcast the decision which it is theirs to make.Let them decide whether my position on the ticket will help or hurt. AndI am going to ask you to help them decide. Wire and write the RepublicanNational Committee whether you think I should stay on or whether I shouldget off. And whatever their decision is, I will abide by it.But just let me say this last word: Regardless of what happens, I'mgoing to continue this fight. I'm going to campaign up and down in Americauntil we drive the crooks and the Communists and those that defend themout of Washington. And remember folks, Eisenhower is a great man, believeme.

",,,7," Ronald Reagan -- Address to the Nation on The Space ShuttleChallenger DisasterRonald ReaganThe Space Shuttle Challenger Tragedy Address delivered 28 January 1986Video Purchase  Plug-in required for flash audiovar so = new    (,""playlistreaganchallenger."")   ; for flash[  fromaudio.]Ladies and Gentlemen, I'd planned to speakto you tonight to report on the state of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change thoseplans. Today is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core bythe tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the peopleof our country. This is truly a national loss.Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in aterrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight. We've neverhad a tragedy like this.And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew ofthe shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame themand did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe.We mourntheir loss as a nation together.For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the fullimpact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much.Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that specialspirit that says, Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy. They had ahunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and theydid. They served all of us.We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us.But for twenty-five years the United States space program has been doing just that. We'vegrown used to the idea of space, and, perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We'restill pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America whowere watching the live coverage of the shuttle's take-off. I know it's hard tounderstand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process ofexploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challengercrew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.I've always had great faith in and respect for our space program. And what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute. We'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.I want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman whoworks for NASA, or who worked on this mission and tell them: Your dedication andprofessionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. Weshare it.There's a coincidence today. On this day three hundred and ninety years ago, the greatexplorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime thegreat frontiers were the oceans, and a historian later said, He lived by the sea,died on it, and was buried in it. Well, today, we can say of the Challenger crew:Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner inwhich they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them,this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped thesurly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.Thank you.George W.

(2)]Reverend Meza, Reverend Reck, I'm grateful for your generous invitationto state my views. While the so-called religious issue is necessarily and properly thechief topic here tonight, I want to emphasize from the outset that I believethat we have far more critical issues in the 1960 campaign; the spreadof Communist influence, until it now festers only 90 miles from the coastof Florida -- the humiliating treatment of our President and Vice Presidentby those who no longer respect our power -- the hungry children I saw inWest Virginia, the old people who cannot pay their doctors bills, the familiesforced to give up their farms -- an America with too many slums, with toofew schools, and too late to the moon and outer space. These are the realissues which should decide this campaign. And they are not religious issues-- for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barrier.But because I am a Catholic, and no Catholic has ever been elected President,the real issues in this campaign have been obscured -- perhaps deliberately,in some quarters less responsible than this. So it is apparently necessaryfor me to state once again -- not what kind of church I believe in, forthat should be important only tome -- but what kind of America Ibelieve in.I believe in an America where the separation of church and state isabsolute; where no Catholic prelate would tell the President-- shouldhe be Catholic -- how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell hisparishioners for whom to vote; where no church or church school is grantedany public funds or political preference, and where no man is denied publicoffice merely because his religion differs from the President who mightappoint him, or the people who might elect him.I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestantnor Jewish; where no public official either requests or accept instructionson public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or anyother ecclesiastical source; where no religious body seeks to impose itswill directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public actsof its officials, and where religious liberty is so indivisible that anact against one church is treated as an act against all. For while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the finger ofsuspicion is pointed, in other years it has been -- and may someday beagain -- a Jew, or a Quaker, or a Unitarian, or a Baptist. It was Virginia'sharassment of Baptist preachers, for example, that led to Jefferson's statuteof religious freedom. Today, I may be the victim, but tomorrow it may beyou -- until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apartat a time of great national peril. Finally, I believe in an America where religious intolerance will somedayend, where all men and all churches are treated as equals, where everyman has the same right to attend or not to attend the church of his choice,where there is no Catholic vote, no anti-Catholic vote, no bloc votingof any kind, and where Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, at both the layand the pastoral levels, will refrain from those attitudes of disdain anddivision which have so often marred their works in the past, and promoteinstead the American ideal of brotherhood. That is the kind of America in which I believe. And it represents thekind of Presidency in which I believe, a great office that must be neitherhumbled by making it the instrument of any religious group nor tarnishedby arbitrarily withholding it -- its occupancy from the members of any one religiousgroup. I believe in a President whose views on religion are his own privateaffair, neither imposed upon him by the nation, nor imposed by the nationupon himå_ as a condition to holding that office. I would not look with favor upon a President working to subvert thefirst amendment's guarantees of religious liberty; nor would our systemof checks and balances permit him to do so. And neither do I look withfavor upon those who would work to subvert Article VI of the Constitutionby requiring a religious test, even by indirection. For if they disagreewith that safeguard, they should be openly working to repeal it. I want a Chief Executive whose public acts are responsible to all andobligated to none, who can attend any ceremony, service, or dinner hisoffice may appropriately require of him to fulfill; and whose fulfillmentof his Presidential office is not limited or conditioned by any religiousoath, ritual, or obligation. This is the kind of America I believe in -- and this is the kind ofAmerica I fought for in the South Pacific, and the kind my brother diedfor in Europe. No one suggested then that we might have a divided loyalty,that we did not believe in liberty, or that we belonged to a disloyal groupthat threatened -- I quote -- ""the freedoms for which our forefathers died."" And in fact this is the kind of America for which our forefathers diddie when they fled here to escape religious test oaths that denied office tomembers of less favored churches -- when they fought for the Constitution,the Bill of Rights, the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom -- and whenthey fought at the shrine I visited today, the Alamo. For side by sidewith Bowie and Crockett died Fuentes, and McCafferty, and Bailey, and Badillo,and Carey -- but no one knows whether they were Catholics or not. For therewas no religious test there. I ask you tonight to follow in that tradition -- to judge me on thebasis of 14 years in the Congress, on my declared stands against an Ambassadorto the Vatican, against unconstitutional aid to parochial schools, andagainst any boycott of the public schools -- which I attended myself. Andinstead of doing this, do not judge me on the basis of these pamphletsand publications we all have seen that carefully select quotations outof context from the statements of Catholic church leaders, usually in othercountries, frequently in other centuries, and rarely relevant to any situationhere. And always omitting, of course, the statement of the American Bishopsin 1948 which strongly endorsed Church-State separation, and which morenearly reflects the views of almost every American Catholic. I do not consider these other quotations binding upon my public acts.Why should you? But let me say, with respect to other countries, that I am wholly opposedto the State being used by any religious group, Catholic or Protestant,to compel, prohibit, or prosecute the free exercise of any other religion.And that goes for any persecution, at any time, by anyone, in any country.And I hope that you and I condemn with equal fervor those nations whichdeny their Presidency to Protestants, and those which deny it to Catholics.And rather than cite the misdeeds of those who differ, I would also citethe record of the Catholic Church in such nations as France and Ireland,and the independence of such statesmen as De Gaulle and Adenauer. But let me stress again that these are my views. For contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidatefor President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who happens alsoto be a Catholic. I do not speak for my church on public matters; and the church doesnot speak for me. Whatever issue may come before me as President, if Ishould be elected, on birth control, divorce, censorship, gamblingor any other subject, I will make my decision in accordance with theseviews -- in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be in the nationalinterest, and without regard to outside religious pressure or dictates.And no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise. But if the time should ever come -- and I do not concede any conflictto be remotely possible -- when my office would require me to either violatemy conscience or violate the national interest, then I would resign theoffice; and I hope any conscientious public servant would do likewise. But I do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of eitherCatholic or Protestant faith; nor do I intend to disavow either my viewsor my church in order to win this election. If I should lose on the real issues, I shall return to my seat in theSenate, satisfied that I'd tried my best and was fairly judged. But if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americanslost their chance of being President on the day they were baptized, thenit is the whole nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholicsand non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of history, and in theeyes of our own people. But if, on the other hand, I should win this election, then I shalldevote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfilling the oath of the Presidency-- practically identical, I might add, with the oath I have taken for 14years in the Congress. For without reservation, I can,""solemnlyswear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the UnitedStates, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defendthe Constitution -- so help me God.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Plug-in required for flash audiovar so = new );  "", ""lbjweshallovercome2233."");   ; for flash[  fromaudio.]Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress:I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny ofdemocracy.I urge every member of both parties, Americans of all religions and of allcolors, from every section of this country, to join me in that cause.At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place toshape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom. So it was at Lexington andConcord. So it was a century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.There, long-suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights asAmericans. Many were brutally assaulted. One good man, a man of God, was killed.There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma. There isno cause for self-satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions ofAmericans. But there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happeninghere tonight. For the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed peoplehave summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government -- the governmentof the greatest nation on earth. Our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic ofthis country: to right wrong, to do justice, to serve man.In our time we have come to live with the moments of great crisis.Our lives have been marked with debate about great issues -- issues of war and peace, issuesof prosperity and depression. But rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secretheart of America itself. Rarely are we met with a challenge, not to our growth orabundance, or our welfare or our security, but rather to the values, and the purposes, andthe meaning of our beloved nation.The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue.And should we defeat every enemy, and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation. For with a country as with a person, What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?There is no Negro problem. There is no Southern problem. There is noNorthern problem. There is only an American problem. And we are met here tonight asAmericans -- not as Democrats or Republicans. We are met here as Americans to solve thatproblem.This was the first nation in the history of the world to be foundedwith a purpose. The great phrases of that purpose still sound in every American heart,North and South: All men are created equal, government by consent of thegoverned, give me liberty or give me death. Well, those are not justclever words, or those are not just empty theories. In their name Americans have foughtand died for two centuries, and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians ofour liberty, risking their lives.Those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share inthe dignity of man. This dignity cannot be found in a man's possessions; it cannot befound in his power, or in his position. It really rests on his right to be treated as aman equal in opportunity to all others. It says that he shall share in freedom, he shallchoose his leaders, educate his children, provide for his family according to his abilityand his merits as a human being. To apply any other test -- to deny a man his hopes because of hiscolor, or race, or his religion, or the place of his birth is not only to do injustice,it is to deny America and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for American freedom.Our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of manwas to flourish, it must be rooted in democracy. The most basic right of all was the rightto choose your own leaders. The history of this country, in large measure, is the historyof the expansion of that right to all of our people. Many of the issues of civil rightsare very complex and most difficult. But about this there can and should be no argument.Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote.There is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right. Thereis no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right.Yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men andwomen are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes. Every device of which humaningenuity is capable has been used to deny this right. The Negro citizen may go toregister only to be told that the day is wrong, or the hour is late, or the official incharge is absent. And if he persists, and if he manages to present himself to theregistrar, he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or becausehe abbreviated a word on the application. And if he manages to fill out an application, heis given a test. The registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test. He may beasked to recite the entire Constitution, or explain the most complex provisions of Statelaw. And even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write.For the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to showa white skin. Experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannotovercome systematic and ingenious discrimination. No law that we now have on the books --and I have helped to put three of them there -- can ensure the right to vote when localofficials are determined to deny it. In such a case our duty must be clear to all of us. The Constitutionsays that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color. We haveall sworn an oath before God to support and to defend that Constitution. We must now actin obedience to that oath.Wednesday, I will send to Congress a law designed to eliminateillegal barriers to the right to vote.The broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of theDemocratic and Republican leaders tomorrow. After they have reviewed it, it will come hereformally as a bill. I am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at theinvitation of the leadership to reason with my friends, to give them my views, and tovisit with my former colleagues. I've had prepared a more comprehensive analysisof the legislation which I had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow, but which Iwill submit to the clerks tonight. But I want to really discuss with you now, briefly, themain proposals of this legislation.This bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections-- Federal, State, and local -- which have been used to deny Negroes the right tovote. This bill will establish a simple, uniform standard which cannot be used,however ingenious the effort, to flout our Constitution. It will provide for citizens tobe registered by officials of the United States Government, if the State officials refuseto register them. It will eliminate tedious, unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right tovote. Finally, this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are notprohibited from voting.I will welcome the suggestions from all of the Members of Congress-- I have no doubt that I will get some -- on ways and means to strengthen this law and tomake it effective. But experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carryout the command of the Constitution.To those who seek to avoid action by their National Government intheir own communities, who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control overelections, the answer is simple: open your polling places to all your people.Allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of theirskin.Extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land.There is no constitutional issue here. The command of theConstitution is plain. There is no moral issue. It is wrong -- deadly wrong -- to deny anyof your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country. There is no issue of States'rights or national rights. There is only the struggle for human rights. I have not theslightest doubt what will be your answer. But the last time a President sent a civil rights bill to theCongress, it contained a provision to protect voting rights in Federal elections. Thatcivil rights bill was passed after eight long months of debate. And when that bill came tomy desk from the Congress for my signature, the heart of the voting provision had beeneliminated. This time, on this issue, there must be no delay, or no hesitation, or nocompromise with our purpose.We cannot, we must not, refuse to protect the right of everyAmerican to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in. And we ought not,and we cannot, and we must not wait another eight months before we get a bill. We havealready waited a hundred years and more, and the time for waiting is gone.So I ask you to join me in working long hours -- nights andweekends, if necessary -- to pass this bill. And I don't make that request lightly. Forfrom the window where I sit with the problems of our country, I recognize that from outsidethis chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation, the grave concern of many nations,and the harsh judgment of history on our acts.But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. Whathappened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section andState of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the fullblessings of American life. Their cause must be our cause too. Because it's not just Negroes,but really it's all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry andinjustice.And we shall overcome.As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil, I know howagonizing racial feelings are. I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and thestructure of our society. But a century has passed, more than a hundred years since the Negrowas freed. And he is not fully free tonight. It was more than a hundred years ago that Abraham Lincoln, a greatPresident of another party, signed the Emancipation Proclamation; but emancipation is aproclamation, and not a fact. A century has passed, more than a hundred years, since equality waspromised. And yet the Negro is not equal. A century has passed since the day of promise. And the promise is un-kept.The time of justice has now come. I tell you that I believesincerely that no force can hold it back. It is right in the eyes of man and God that itshould come. And when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American.For Negroes are not the only victims. How many white children have gone uneducated? Howmany white families have lived in stark poverty? How many white lives have been scarred byfear, because we've wasted our energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatredand terror?And so I say to all of you here, and to all in the nation tonight, that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future.This great, rich, restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all, all black and white, all North and South, sharecropper and city dweller. These are the enemies: poverty, ignorance, disease. They're our enemies, not our fellow man, not our neighbor. And these enemies too -- poverty, disease, and ignorance: we shall overcome.Now let none of us in any section look with prideful righteousnesson the troubles in another section, or the problems of our neighbors. There's really nopart of America where the promise of equality has been fully kept. In Buffalo as well asin Birmingham, in Philadelphia as well as Selma, Americans are struggling for thefruits of freedom. This is one nation. What happens in Selma or in Cincinnati is a matterof legitimate concern to every American. But let each of us look within our own hearts andour own communities, and let each of us put our shoulder to the wheel to root outinjustice wherever it exists.As we meet here in this peaceful, historic chamber tonight, men fromthe South, some of whom were at Iwo Jima, men from the North who have carried Old Glory tofar corners of the world and brought it back without a stain on it, men from the East andfrom the West, are all fighting together without regard to religion, or color, or region,in Vietnam. Men from every region fought for us across the world twenty years ago.And now in these common dangers and these common sacrifices, theSouth made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region in theGreat Republic -- and in some instances, a great many of them, more.And I have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere inthis country, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, from the Golden Gate to theharbors along the Atlantic, will rally now together in this cause to vindicate the freedomof all Americans.For all of us owe this duty; and I believe that all of us willrespond to it. Your President makes that request of every American.The real hero of this struggle is the American Negro. His actionsand protests, his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life, have awakened theconscience of this nation. His demonstrations have been designed to call attention toinjustice, designed to provoke change, designed to stir reform. He has called upon us tomake good the promise of America. And who among us can say that we would have made thesame progress were it not for his persistent bravery, and his faith in American democracy.For at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep seated beliefin the democratic process. Equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas butdepends upon the force of moral right; not on recourse to violence but on respect for lawand order.And there have been many pressures upon your President and therewill be others as the days come and go. But I pledge you tonight that we intend to fightthis battle where it should be fought -- in the courts, and in the Congress, and in thehearts of men.We must preserve the right of free speech and the right of freeassembly. But the right of free speech does not carry with it, as has been said, the rightto holler fire in a crowded theater. We must preserve the right to free assembly. But freeassembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares to traffic.We do have a right to protest, and a right to march under conditionsthat do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors. And I intend to protectall those rights as long as I am permitted to serve in this office.We will guard against violence, knowing it strikes from our handsthe very weapons which we seek: progress, obedience to law, and belief in American values.In Selma, as elsewhere, we seek and pray for peace. We seek order.We seek unity. But we will not accept the peace of stifled rights, or the order imposed byfear, or the unity that stifles protest. For peace cannot be purchased at the cost ofliberty.In Selma tonight -- and we had a good day there -- as in every city,we are working for a just and peaceful settlement And we must all remember that after thisspeech I am making tonight, after the police and the FBI and the Marshals have all gone,and after you have promptly passed this bill, the people of Selma and the other cities ofthe Nation must still live and work together. And when the attention of the nation hasgone elsewhere, they must try to heal the wounds and to build a new community.This cannot be easily done on a battleground of violence, as thehistory of the South itself shows. It is in recognition of this that men of both raceshave shown such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent days -- last Tuesday,again today.The bill that I am presenting to you will be known as a civil rightsbill. But, in a larger sense, most of the program I am recommending is a civil rightsprogram. Its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races.Because all Americans just must have the right to vote. And we aregoing to give them that right. All Americans must have the privileges of citizenship -- regardlessof race. And they are going to have those privileges of citizenship -- regardless of race.But I would like to caution you and remind you that to exercisethese privileges takes much more than just legal right. It requires a trained mind and ahealthy body. It requires a decent home, and the chance to find a job, and the opportunityto escape from the clutches of poverty.Of course, people cannot contribute to the nation if they are nevertaught to read or write, if their bodies are stunted from hunger, if their sickness goesuntended, if their life is spent in hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check. So wewant to open the gates to opportunity. But we're also going to give all our people, blackand white, the help that they need to walk through those gates. My first job after college was as a teacher in Cotulla, Texas, in asmall Mexican-American school. Few of them could speak English, and I couldn't speak muchSpanish. My students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast, hungry. Andthey knew, even in their youth, the pain of prejudice. They never seemed to know whypeople disliked them. But they knew it was so, because I saw it in their eyes. I oftenwalked home late in the afternoon, after the classes were finished, wishing there was morethat I could do. But all I knew was to teach them the little that I knew, hoping that itmight help them against the hardships that lay ahead.And somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when yousee its scars on the hopeful face of a young child. I never thought then, in 1928, that Iwould be standing here in 1965. It never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that Imight have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students and to help peoplelike them all over this country.But now I do have that chance -- and I'll let you in on a secret --I mean to use it.And I hope that you will use it with me. This is the richest and the most powerful country which ever occupiedthis globe. The might of past empires is little compared to ours. But I do not want to be the President who built empires, or sought grandeur, or extended dominion. I want to be the President who educated young children to the wonders of their world. I want to be the President who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be tax-payers instead of tax-eaters.I want to be the President who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election.I want to be the President who helped to end hatred among his fellow men, and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties.I want to be the President who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth.And so, at the request of your beloved Speaker, and the Senator fromMontana, the majority leader, the Senator from Illinois, the minority leader, Mr.McCulloch, and other Members of both parties, I came here tonight -- not as PresidentRoosevelt came down one time, in person, to veto a bonus bill, not as President Trumancame down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill -- but I came down here to askyou to share this task with me, and to share it with the people that we both work for. Iwant this to be the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, which did all these thingsfor all these people.Beyond this great chamber, out yonder in fifty States, are thepeople that we serve. Who can tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their heartstonight as they sit there and listen. We all can guess, from our own lives, how difficultthey often find their own pursuit of happiness, how many problems each little family has.They look most of all to themselves for their futures. But I think that they also look toeach of us.Above the pyramid on the great seal of the United States it says inLatin: God has favored our undertaking. God will not favor everything that we do. It is rather our duty to divine His will. But I cannot help believing that He truly understands and that He really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight.Book/CDs by Michael E.

(2)]Thank you very much.On behalf of the great Empire State and the whole family of New York, let me thankyou for the great privilege of being able to address this convention. Please allow me toskip the stories and the poetry and the temptation to deal in nice but vague rhetoric. Letme instead use this valuable opportunity to deal immediately with the questions that shoulddetermine this election and that we all know are vital to the American people.Ten days ago, President Reagan admitted that although some people inthis country seemed to be doing well nowadays, others were unhappy, even worried, aboutthemselves, their families, and their futures. The President said that he didn't understandthat fear. He said, Why, this country is a shining city on a hill. And the President is right. In many ways we are a shining city on a hill.But the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city'ssplendor and glory. A shining city is perhaps all the President sees from the portico ofthe White House and the veranda of his ranch, where everyone seems to be doing well. Butthere's another city; there's another part to the shining the city; the part where somepeople can't pay their mortgages, and most young people can't afford one; where studentscan't afford the education they need, and middle-class parents watch the dreams they holdfor their children evaporate.In this part of the city there are more poor than ever, morefamilies in trouble, more and more people who need help but can't find it. Even worse:There are elderly people who tremble in the basements of the houses there. And there arepeople who sleep in the city streets, in the gutter, where the glitter doesn't show. Thereare ghettos where thousands of young people, without a job or an education, give theirlives away to drug dealers every day. There is despair, Mr. President, in the faces thatyou don't see, in the places that you don't visit in your shining city.In fact, Mr. President, this is a nation -- Mr. President you oughtto know that this nation is more a Tale of Two Cities than it is just aShining City on a Hill.Maybe, maybe, Mr. President, if you visited some more places; maybeif you went to Appalachia where some people still live in sheds; maybe if you went toLackawanna where thousands of unemployed steel workers wonder why we subsidized foreignsteel. Maybe -- Maybe, Mr. President, if you stopped in at a shelter in Chicago and spoke tothe homeless there; maybe, Mr. President, if you asked a woman who had been denied thehelp she needed to feed her children because you said you needed the money for a tax breakfor a millionaire or for a missile we couldn't afford to use.Maybe -- Maybe, Mr. President. But I'm afraid not. Because the truth is, ladies and gentlemen, that this is how wewere warned it would be. President Reagan told us from the very beginning that he believedin a kind of social Darwinism. Survival of the fittest. Government can't doeverything, we were told, so it should settle for taking care of the strongand hope that economic ambition and charity will do the rest. Make the rich richer, andwhat falls from the table will be enough for the middle class and those who are tryingdesperately to work their way into the middle class.You know, the Republicans called it trickle-down when Hoover triedit. Now they call it supply side. But it's the same shining city for those relative fewwho are lucky enough to live in its good neighborhoods. But for the people who areexcluded, for the people who are locked out, all they can do is stare from adistance at that city's glimmering towers.It's an old story. It's as old as our history. The differencebetween Democrats and Republicans has always been measured in courage and confidence. TheRepublicans -- The Republicans believe that the wagon train will not make it to the frontier unless some ofthe old, some of the young, some of the weak are left behind by the side of the trail. The strong -- The strong, they tell us, will inherit the land.We Democrats believe in something else. We democrats believe that we can make it all the way with the whole family intact, and we have more than once. Ever since Franklin Roosevelt lifted himself from his wheelchair tolift this nation from its knees -- wagon train after wagon train -- to new frontiers ofeducation, housing, peace; the whole family aboard, constantly reaching out to extend andenlarge that family; lifting them up into the wagon on the way; blacks and Hispanics, andpeople of every ethnic group, and native Americans -- all those struggling to build theirfamilies and claim some small share of America. For nearly 50 years we carried them all to new levels of comfort, and security, and dignity, even affluence. And remember this, some of us in this room today are here only because this nation had that kind of confidence. And it would be wrong to forget that. So, here we are at this convention to remind ourselves where we come from and to claim the future for ourselves and for our children. Today our great Democratic Party, which has saved this nation fromdepression, from fascism, from racism, from corruption, is called upon to do it again --this time to save the nation from confusion and division, from the threat of eventualfiscal disaster, and most of all from the fear of a nuclear holocaust. That's not going to be easy. Mo Udall is exactly right -- it won't be easy. And in order to succeed, we must answer our opponent's polished andappealing rhetoric with a more telling reasonableness and rationality.We must win this case on the merits. We must get the American publicto look past the glitter, beyond the showmanship to the reality, the hard substance ofthings. And we'll do it not so much with speeches that sound good as with speechesthat are good and sound; not so much with speeches that will bring people to their feet aswith speeches that will bring people to their senses. We must make -- We must make the American people hear ourTale of Two Cities. We must convince them that we don't have to settle for twocities, that we can have one city, indivisible, shining for all of its people.Now, we will have no chance to do that if what comes out of thisconvention is a babel of arguing voices. If that's what's heard throughout the campaign,dissident sounds from all sides, we will have no chance to tell our message. To succeedwe will have to surrender some small parts of our individual interests, to build a platform that wecan all stand on, at once, and comfortably -- proudly singing out. We need -- We need a platform we can all agree to so that we can sing out the truth for the nation tohear, in chorus, its logic so clear and commanding that no slick Madison Avenue commercial, no amount ofgeniality, no martial music will be able to muffle the sound of the truth.And we Democratsmust unite. We Democrats must unite so that the entire nation can unite, becausesurely the Republicans won't bring this country together. Their policies divide the nationinto the lucky and the left-out, into the royalty and the rabble. The Republicans arewilling to treat that division as victory. They would cut this nation in half, into thosetemporarily better off and those worse off than before, and they would call that divisionrecovery.Now, we should not -- we should not be embarrassed or dismayed or chagrinedif the process of unifying is difficult, even wrenching at times. Remember that, unlikeany other Party, we embrace men and women of every color, every creed, every orientation,every economic class. In our family are gathered everyone from the abject poor of EssexCounty in New York, to the enlightened affluent of the gold coasts at both ends of thenation. And in between is the heart of our constituency -- the middle class, the peoplenot rich enough to be worry-free, but not poor enough to be on welfare; the middle class --those people who work for a living because they have to, not because some psychiatristtold them it was a convenient way to fill the interval between birth and eternity. Whitecollar and blue collar. Young professionals. Men and women in small business desperate forthe capital and contracts that they need to prove their worth.We speak for the minorities who have not yet entered the mainstream.We speak for ethnics who want to add their culture to the magnificent mosaic that isAmerica. We speak -- We speak for women who are indignant that this nation refuses to etchinto its governmental commandments the simple rule thou shalt not sin againstequality, a rule so simple -- I was going to say, and I perhaps dare not but I will. It's a commandment so simple it can be spelled in three letters: E.R.A.We speak -- We speak for young people demanding an education and a future. Wespeak for senior citizens. We speak for senior citizens who are terrorized by the idea that their only security, theirSocial Security, is being threatened. We speak for millions of reasoning people fightingto preserve our environment from greed and from stupidity. And we speak for reasonablepeople who are fighting to preserve our very existence from a macho intransigence thatrefuses to make intelligent attempts to discuss the possibility of nuclear holocaust withour enemy. They refuse. They refuse, because they believe we can pile missiles so highthat they will pierce the clouds and the sight of them will frighten our enemies intosubmission.Now we're proud of this diversity as Democrats. We're grateful forit. We don't have to manufacture it the way the Republicans will next month in Dallas, bypropping up mannequin delegates on the convention floor. But we, while we're proud of thisdiversity, we pay a price for it. The different people that we represent havedifferent points of view. And sometimes they compete and even debate, and even argue.That's what our primaries were all about. But now the primaries are over and it is time,when we pick our candidates and our platform here, to lock arms and move into this campaigntogether.If you need any more inspiration to put some small part of your own differenceaside to create this consensus, then all you need to do is to reflect on what the Republicanpolicy of divide and cajole has done to this land since 1980. Now the President has asked the American people to judge him on whether or not he'sfulfilled the promises he made four years ago. I believe, as Democrats, we ought toaccept that challenge. And just for a moment let us consider what he has said and whathe's done.Inflation -- Inflation is down since 1980, but not because of the supply-side miraclepromised to us by the President. Inflation was reduced the old-fashioned way: with arecession, the worst since 1932. Now how did we -- We could have brought inflation down that way. How did hedo it? 55,000 bankruptcies; two years of massive unemployment; 200,000 farmers and ranchers forced off the land; more homeless -- more homeless than at any time sincethe Great Depression in 1932; more hungry, in this world of enormous affluence, theUnited States of America, more hungry; more poor, most of them women. And -- And he paid oneother thing, a nearly 200 billion dollar deficit threatening our future.Now, we must make the American people understand this deficit becausethey don't. The President's deficit is a direct and dramatic repudiation of his promise in 1980 tobalance the budget by 1983. How large is it? The deficit is the largest in the history ofthe universe. It -- President Carter's last budget had a deficit less than one-third of thisdeficit. It is a deficit that, according to the President's own fiscal adviser, may grow to as much 300 billion dollars a year for as far as the eye can see. And, ladies and gentlemen, it is a debt so large -- that is almostone-half of the money we collect from the personal income tax each year goes just to pay the interest. It is amortgage on our children's future that can be paid only in pain and that could bring thisnation to its knees.Now don't take my word for it -- I'm a Democrat. Ask the Republican investment bankers on Wall Street what they thinkthe chances of this recovery being permanent are. You see, if they're not too embarrassedto tell you the truth, they'll say that they're appalled and frightened by thePresident's deficit. Ask them what they think of our economy, now that it's been drivenby the distorted value of the dollar back to its colonial condition. Now we're exportingagricultural products and importing manufactured ones. Ask those Republican investmentbankers what they expect the rate of interest to be a year from now. And ask them -- if theydare tell you the truth -- you'll learn from them, what they predict for the inflation ratea year from now, because of the deficit.Now, how important is this question of the deficit. Think about it practically: What chance would the Republicancandidate have had in 1980 if he had told the American people that he intended to pay forhis so-called economic recovery with bankruptcies, unemployment, more homeless, morehungry, and the largest government debt known to humankind? If he had told the voters in 1980 that truth, would American voters havesigned the loan certificate for him on Election Day? Of course not! That was an electionwon under false pretenses. It was won with smoke and mirrors and illusions. And that's thekind of recovery we have now as well.But what about foreign policy? They said that they would make us andthe whole world safer. They say they have. By creating the largest defense budget inhistory, one that even they now admit is excessive -- by escalating to a frenzy the nucleararms race; by incendiary rhetoric; by refusing to discuss peace with our enemies; by theloss of 279 young Americans in Lebanon in pursuit of a plan and a policy that no one canfind or describe.We give money to Latin American governments that murder nuns, andthen we lie about it. We have been less than zealous in support of our only real friend --it seems to me, in the Middle East -- the one democracy there, our flesh and bloodally, the state of Israel. Our -- Our policy -- Our foreign policy drifts with no real direction, other than anhysterical commitment to an arms race that leads nowhere -- if we're lucky. And if we'renot, it could lead us into bankruptcy or war.Of course we must have a strong defense! Of course Democrats are for a strong defense. Of course Democratsbelieve that there are times that we must stand and fight. And we have. Thousands of ushave paid for freedom with our lives. But always -- when this country has been at its best-- our purposes were clear. Now they're not. Now our allies are as confused as our enemies.Now we have no real commitment to our friends or to our ideals -- not to human rights, notto the refuseniks, not to Sakharov, not to Bishop Tutu and the others struggling forfreedom in South Africa.We -- We have in the last few years spent more than we can afford. We havepounded our chests and made bold speeches. But we lost 279 young Americans in Lebanon andwe live behind sand bags in Washington. How can anyone say that we are safer, stronger, orbetter?That -- That is the Republican record. That its disastrous quality is not more fully understood by theAmerican people I can only attribute to the President's amiability and the failure by someto separate the salesman from the product.And, now -- now -- now it's up to us. Now it's upto you and to me to make the case to America. And to remind Americans that if they are nothappy with all that the President has done so far, they should consider how much worse it willbe if he is left to his radical proclivities for another four years unrestrained.Unrestrained.Now, if -- if July -- if July brings back Ann Gorsuch Burford -- what can we expect ofDecember? Where would -- Where would another four years take us? Where would four years more take us? Howmuch larger will the deficit be? How much deeper the cuts in programs for the strugglingmiddle class and the poor to limit that deficit? How high will the interest rates be? Howmuch more acid rain killing our forests and fouling our lakes?And, ladies and gentlemen, please think of this -- the nation must think of this: What kind of Supreme Court will we have?Please. [beckons audience to settle down]We -- We must askourselves what kind of court and country will be fashioned by the man who believes inhaving government mandate people's religion and morality; the man who believes that trees pollute the environment; the manthat believes that -- that the laws against discrimination against people go too far; a man whothreatens Social Security and Medicaid and help for the disabled. How high will we pilethe missiles? How much deeper will the gulf be between us and our enemies? And, ladies andgentlemen, will four years more make meaner the spirit ofthe American people? This election will measure the record of the past four years. But more than that, it will answer the question of what kind of people we want to be.We Democrats still have a dream. We still believe in this nation'sfuture. And this is our answer to the question. This is our credo:We believe in only the government we need, but we insist on all thegovernment we need.We believe in a government that is characterized by fairness andreasonableness, a reasonableness that goes beyond labels, that doesn't distort or promiseto do things that we know we can't do.We believe in a government strong enough to use wordslike love and compassion and smart enough to convert our noblestaspirations into practical realities.We believe in encouraging the talented, but webelieve that while survival of the fittest may be a good working description of theprocess of evolution, a government of humans should elevate itself to a higher order.We -- Our -- Our government -- Our government should be able to rise to the level where it canfill the gaps that are left by chance or by a wisdom we don't fully understand. We would rather havelaws written by the patron of this great city, the man called the world's mostsincere Democrat, St. Francis of Assisi, than laws written by Darwin.We believe -- We believe as Democrats, that a society as blessed asours, the most affluent democracy in the world's history, one that can spend trillions oninstruments of destruction, ought to be able to help the middle class in its struggle,ought to be able to find work for all who can do it, room at the table, shelter for thehomeless, care for the elderly and infirm, and hope for the destitute. And we proclaim asloudly as we can the utter insanity of nuclear proliferation and the need for a nuclearfreeze, if only to affirm the simple truth that peace is better than war because life isbetter than death.We believe in firm -- We believe in firm but fair law and order. We believe proudly in theunion movement. We believe in a -- We believe -- We believe in privacy for people, openness by government.We believe incivil rights, and we believe in human rights. We believe in a single -- We believe in a single fundamental idea thatdescribes better than most textbooks and any speech that I could write what a propergovernment should be: the idea of family, mutuality, the sharing of benefits and burdensfor the good of all, feeling one another's pain, sharing one another's blessings -- reasonably, honestly, fairly, without respect to race, or sex, or geography, or politicalaffiliation.We believe we must be the family of America, recognizing that at theheart of the matter we are bound one to another, that the problems of a retired schoolteacher in Duluth are our problems; that the future of the child -- that the future of the child in Buffalo is our future; that the struggle of a disabled man in Boston to survive and live decently is ourstruggle; that the hunger of a woman in Little Rock is our hunger; that the failureanywhere to provide what reasonably we might, to avoid pain, is our failure.Now for 50 years -- for 50 years we Democrats created a better futurefor our children, using traditional Democratic principles as a fixed beacon, giving usdirection and purpose, but constantly innovating, adapting to new realities: Roosevelt'salphabet programs; Truman's NATO andthe GI Bill of Rights; Kennedy's intelligent taxincentives and the Alliance for Progress; Johnson's civil rights; Carter's human rightsand the nearly miraculousCamp David Peace Accord.Democrats did it -- Democrats did it and Democrats can do it again.We can build a future that deals with our deficit. Remember this, that 50 years ofprogress under our principles never cost us what the last four years of stagnation have.And we can deal with the deficit intelligently, by shared sacrifice, with all parts ofthe nation's family contributing, building partnerships with the private sector, providinga sound defense without depriving ourselves of what we need to feed our children and carefor our people. We can have a future that provides for all the young of the present,by marrying common sense and compassion. We know we can, because we did it fornearly 50 years before 1980. And we can do it again, if we do not forget -- if we do not forgetthat this entire nation has profited by these progressive principles; that they helpedlift up generations to the middle class and higher; that they gave us a chance to work, to go tocollege, to raise a family, to own a house, to be secure in our old age and, before that,to reach heights that our own parents would not have dared dream of.That struggle to live with dignity is the real story of the shiningcity. And it's a story, ladies and gentlemen, that I didn't read in a book, or learn in aclassroom. I saw it and lived it, like many of you. I watched a small man with thickcalluses on both his hands work 15 and 16 hours a day. I saw him once literally bleed from thebottoms of his feet, a man who came here uneducated, alone, unable to speak the language,who taught me all I needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence ofhis example. I learned about our kind of democracy from my father. And I learned aboutour obligation to each other from him and from my mother. They asked only for a chance towork and to make the world better for their children, and they -- they asked to be protected inthose moments when they would not be able to protect themselves. This nation and thisnation's government did that for them.And that they were able to build a family and live in dignity and see one of their children go from behind their little grocery store in South Jamaica on the other side of the tracks where he was born, to occupy the highest seat, in the greatest State, in the greatest nation, in the only world we would know, is an ineffably beautiful tributeto the democratic process.And -- And ladies and gentlemen, on January 20, 1985, it will happenagain -- only on a much, much grander scale. We will have a new President of the UnitedStates, a Democrat born not to the blood of kings but to the blood of pioneers andimmigrants. And we will have America's first woman Vice President, the child ofimmigrants, and she -- she -- she will open with one magnificent stroke, a whole new frontierfor the United States.Now, it will happen. It will happen if we make it happen; if you and I make ithappen. And I ask you now, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, forthe good of all of us, for the love of this great nation, for the family of America, forthe love of God: Please, make this nation remember how futures are built.Thank you and God bless you.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Tonight we come together bound by our faith in a mighty God, with genuine respect and love for our country, and inheriting the legacy of a great Party, the Democratic Party, which is the best hope for redirecting our nation on a more humane, just, and peaceful course.  This is not a perfect party. We are not a perfect people. Yet, we are called to a perfect mission. Our mission: to feed the hungry; to clothe the naked; to house the homeless; to teach the illiterate; to provide jobs for the jobless; and to choose the human race over the nuclear race.  We are gathered here this week to nominate a candidate and adopt a platform which will expand, unify, direct, and inspire our Party and the nation to fulfill this mission. My constituency is the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised. They are restless and seek relief. They have voted in record numbers. They have invested the faith, hope, and trust that they have in us. The Democratic Party must send them a signal that we care. I pledge my best not to let them down.There is the call of conscience, redemption, expansion, healing, and unity. Leadership must heed the call of conscience, redemption, expansion, healing, and unity, for they are the key to achieving our mission. Time is neutral and does not change things. With courage and initiative, leaders change things.  No generation can choose the age or circumstance in which it is born, but through leadership it can choose to make the age in which it is born an age of enlightenment, an age of jobs, and peace, and justice. Only leadership -- that intangible combination of gifts, the discipline, information, circumstance, courage, timing, will and divine inspiration -- can lead us out of the crisis in which we find ourselves. Leadership can mitigate the misery of our nation. Leadership can part thewaters and lead our nation in the direction of the Promised Land. Leadership can lift the boats stuck at the bottom.I have had the rare opportunity to watch seven men, and then two, pour out their souls, offer their service, and heal and heed the call of duty to direct the course of our nation. There is a proper season for everything. There is a time to sow and a time to reap. There's a time to compete and a time to cooperate.  I ask for your vote on the first ballot as a vote for a new direction for this Party and this nation -- a vote of conviction, a vote of conscience. But I will be proud to support the nominee of this convention for the Presidency of the United States of America. Thank you.  I have watched the leadership of our party develop and grow. My respect for both Mr. Mondale and Mr. Hart is great. I have watched them struggle with the crosswinds and crossfires of being public servants, and I believe they will both continue to try to serve us faithfully.  I am elated by the knowledge that for the first time in our history a woman, Geraldine Ferraro, will be recommended to share our ticket.Throughout this campaign, I've tried to offer leadership to the Democratic Party and the nation. If, in my high moments, I have done some good, offered some service, shed some light, healed some wounds, rekindled some hope, or stirred someone from apathy and indifference, or in any way along the way helped somebody, then this campaign has not been in vain.  For friends who loved and cared for me, and for a God who spared me, and for a family who understood, I am eternally grateful.If, in my low moments, in word, deed or attitude, through some error of temper, taste, or tone, I have caused anyone discomfort, created pain, or revived someone's fears, that was not my truest self. If there were occasions when my grape turned into a raisin and my joy bell lost its resonance, please forgive me. Charge it to my head and not to my heart. My head -- so limited in its finitude; my heart, which is boundless in its love for the human family. I am not a perfect servant. I am a public servant doing my best against the odds. As I develop and serve, be patient: God is not finished with me yet.This campaign has taught me much; that leaders must be tough enough to fight, tender enough to cry, human enough to make mistakes, humble enough to admit them, strong enough to absorb the pain, and resilient enough to bounce back and keep on moving.  For leaders, the pain is often intense. But you must smile through your tears and keep moving with the faith that there is a brighter side somewhere.I went to see Hubert Humphrey three days before he died. He had just called Richard Nixon from his dying bed, and many people wondered why. And I asked him. He said, Jesse, from this vantage point, the sun is setting in my life, all of the speeches, the political conventions, the crowds, and the great fights are behind me now. At a time like this you are forced to deal with your irreducible essence, forced to grapple with that which is really important to you. And what I've concluded about life, Hubert Humphrey said, When all is said and done, we must forgive each other, and redeem each other, and move on.  Our party is emerging from one of its most hard fought battles for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in our history. But our healthy competition should make us better, not bitter. We must use the insight, wisdom, and experience of the late Hubert Humphrey as a balm for the wounds in our Party, this nation, and the world. We must forgive each other, redeem each other, regroup, and move one. Our flag is red, white and blue, but our nation is a rainbow -- red, yellow, brown, black and white -- and we're all precious in God's sight.America is not like a blanket -- one piece of unbroken cloth, the same color, the same texture, the same size. America is more like a quilt: many patches, many pieces, many colors, many sizes, all woven and held together by a common thread. The white, the Hispanic, the black, the Arab, the Jew, the woman, the native American, the small farmer, the businessperson, the environmentalist, the peace activist, the young, the old, the lesbian, the gay, and the disabled make up the American quilt.Even in our fractured state, all of us count and fit somewhere. We have proven that we can survive without each other. But we have not proven that we can win and make progress without each other. We must come together.From Fannie Lou Hamer in Atlantic City in 1964 to the Rainbow Coalition in San Francisco today; from the Atlantic to the Pacific, we have experienced pain but progress, as we ended American apartheid laws. We got public accommodations. We secured voting rights. We obtained open housing, as young people got the right to vote. We lost Malcolm, Martin, Medgar, Bobby, John, and Viola. The team that got us here must be expanded, not abandoned.Twenty years ago, tears welled up in our eyes as the bodies of Schwerner, Goodman, and Chaney were dredged from the depths of a river in Mississippi. Twenty years later, our communities, black and Jewish, are in anguish, anger, and pain. Feelings have been hurt on both sides. There is a crisis in communications. Confusion is in the air. But we cannot afford to lose our way. We may agree to agree; or agree to disagree on issues; we must bring back civility to these tensions.We are co-partners in a long and rich religious history -- the Judeo-Christian traditions. Many blacks and Jews have a shared passion for social justice at home and peace abroad. We must seek a revival of the spirit, inspired by a new vision and new possibilities. We must return to higher ground. We are bound by Moses and Jesus, but also connected with Islam and Mohammed. These three great religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, were all born in the revered and holy city of Jerusalem.We are bound by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Abraham Heschel, crying out from their graves for us to reach common ground. We are bound by shared blood and shared sacrifices. We are much too intelligent, much too bound by our Judeo-Christian heritage, much too victimized by racism, sexism, militarism, and anti-Semitism, much too threatened as historical scapegoats to go on divided one from another. We must turn from finger pointing to clasped hands. We must share our burdens and our joys with each other once again. We must turn to each other and not on each other and choose higher ground.  Twenty years later, we cannot be satisfied by just restoring the old coalition. Old wine skins must make room for new wine. We must heal and expand. The Rainbow Coalition is making room for Arab Americans. They, too, know the pain and hurt of racial and religious rejection. They must not continue to be made pariahs. The Rainbow Coalition is making room for Hispanic Americans who this very night are living under the threat of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill; and farmworkers from Ohio who are fighting the Campbell Soup Company with a boycott to achieve legitimate workers' rights.The Rainbow is making room for the Native American, the most exploited people of all, a people with the greatest moral claim amongst us. We support them as they seek the restoration of their ancient land and claim amongst us. We support them as they seek the restoration of land and water rights, as they seek to preserve their ancestral homeland and the beauty of a land that was once all theirs. They can never receive a fair share for all they have given us. They must finally have a fair chance to develop their great resources and to preserve their people and their culture.The Rainbow Coalition includes Asian Americans, now being killed in our streets -- scapegoats for the failures of corporate, industrial, and economic policies.The Rainbow is making room for the young Americans. Twenty years ago, our young people were dying in a war for which they could not even vote. Twenty years later, young America has the power to stop a war in Central America and the responsibility to vote in great numbers. Young America must be politically active in 1984. The choice is war or peace. We must make room for young America.  The Rainbow includes disabled veterans. The color scheme fits in the Rainbow. The disabled have their handicap revealed and their genius concealed; while the able-bodied have their genius revealed and their disability concealed. But ultimately, we must judge people by their values and their contribution. Don't leave anybody out. I would rather have Roosevelt in a wheelchair than Reagan on a horse.  The Rainbow is making room for small farmers. They have suffered tremendously under the Reagan regime. They will either receive 90 percent parity or 100 percent charity. We must address their concerns and make room for them. The Rainbow includes lesbians and gays. No American citizen ought be denied equal protection from the law.We must be unusually committed and caring as we expand our family to include new members. All of us must be tolerant and understanding as the fears and anxieties of the rejected and the party leadership express themselves in many different ways. Too often what we call hate -- as if it were some deeply-rooted philosophy or strategy -- is simply ignorance, anxiety, paranoia, fear, and insecurity. To be strong leaders, we must be long-suffering as we seek to right the wrongs of our Party and our nation. We must expand our Party, heal our Party, and unify our Party. That is our mission in 1984.We are often reminded that we live in a great nation -- and we do. But it can be greater still. The Rainbow is mandating a new definition of greatness. We must not measure greatness from the mansion down, but the manger up. Jesus said that we should not be judged by the bark we wear but by the fruit that we bear. Jesus said that we must measure greatness by how we treat the least of these.  President Reagan says the nation is in recovery. Those 90,000 corporations that made a profit last year but paid no federal taxes are recovering. The 37,000 military contractors who have benefited from Reagan's more than doubling of the military budget in peacetime, surely they are recovering. The big corporations and rich individuals who received the bulk of a three-year, multibillion tax cut from Mr. Reagan are recovering. But no such recovery is under way for the least of these.Rising tides don't lift all boats, particularly those stuck at the bottom. For the boats stuck at the bottom there's a misery index. This Administration has made life more miserable for the poor. Its attitude has been contemptuous. Its policies and programs have been cruel and unfair to working people. They must be held accountable in November for increasing infant mortality among the poor. In Detroit one of the great cities of the western world, babies are dying at the same rate as Honduras, the most underdeveloped nation in our hemisphere. This Administration must be held accountable for policies that have contributed to the growing poverty in America. There are now 34 million people in poverty, 15 percent of our nation. 23 million are White; 11 million Black, Hispanic, Asian, and others -- mostly women and children. By the end of this year, there will be 41 million people in poverty. We cannot stand idly by. We must fight for a change now.Under this regime we look at Social Security. The '81 budget cuts included nine permanent Social Security benefit cuts totaling  20 billion over five years. Small businesses have suffered under Reagan tax cuts. Only 18 percent of total business tax cuts went to them; 82 percent to big businesses. Health care under Mr. Reagan has already been sharply cut. Education under Mr. Reagan has been cut 25 percent. Under Mr. Reagan there are now 9.7 million female head families. They represent 16 percent of all families. Half of all of them are poor. 70 percent of all poor children live in a house headed by a woman, where there is no man. Under Mr. Reagan, the Administration has cleaned up only 6 of 546 priority toxic waste dumps. Farmers' real net income was only about half its level in 1979.  Many say that the race in November will be decided in the South. President Reagan is depending on the conservative South to return him to office. But the South, I tell you, is unnaturally conservative. The South is the poorest region in our nation and, therefore, [has] the least to conserve. In his appeal to the South, Mr. Reagan is trying to substitute flags and prayer cloths for food, and clothing, and education, health care, and housing.  Mr. Reagan will ask us to pray, and I believe in prayer. I have come to this way by the power of prayer. But then, we must watch false prophecy. He cuts energy assistance to the poor, cuts breakfast programs from children, cuts lunch programs from children, cuts job training from children, and then says to an empty table, Let us pray. Apparently, he is not familiar with the structure of a prayer. You thank the Lord for the food that you are about to receive, not the food that just left. I think that we should pray, but don't pray for the food that left. Pray for the man that took the food to leave. We need a change. We need a change in November.  Under Mr. Reagan, the misery index has risen for the poor. The danger index has risen for everybody. Under this administration, we've lost the lives of our boys in Central America and Honduras, in Grenada, in Lebanon, in nuclear standoff in Europe. Under this Administration, one-third of our children believe they will die in a nuclear war. The danger index is increasing in this world. All the talk about the defense against Russia; the Russian submarines are closer, and their missiles are more accurate. We live in a world tonight more miserable and a world more dangerous.While Reaganomics and Reaganism is talked about often, so often we miss the real meaning. Reaganism is a spirit, and Reaganomics represents the real economic facts of life. In 1980, Mr. George Bush, a man with reasonable access to Mr. Reagan, did an analysis of Mr. Reagan's economic plan. Mr. George Bush concluded that Reagan's plan was ''voodoo economics.'' He was right. Third-party candidate John Anderson said a combination of military spending, tax cuts, and a balanced budget by '84 would be accomplished with blue smoke and mirrors. They were both right.Mr. Reagan talks about a dynamic recovery. There's some measure of recovery. Three and a half years later, unemployment has inched just below where it was when he took office in 1981. There are still 8.1 million people officially unemployed; 11 million working only part-time. Inflation has come down, but let's analyze for a moment who has paid the price for this superficial economic recovery.  Mr. Reagan curbed inflation by cutting consumer demand. He cut consumer demand with conscious and callous fiscal and monetary policies. He used the Federal budget to deliberately induce unemployment and curb social spending. He then weighed and supported tight monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board to deliberately drive up interest rates, again to curb consumer demand created through borrowing. Unemployment reached 10.7 percent. We experienced skyrocketing interest rates. Our dollar inflated abroad. There were record bank failures, record farm foreclosures, record business bankruptcies; record budget deficits, record trade deficits.Mr. Reagan brought inflation down by destabilizing our economy and disrupting family life. He promised -- he promised in 1980 a balanced budget. But instead we now have a record 200 billion dollar budget deficit. Under Mr. Reagan, the cumulative budget deficit for his four years is more than the sum total of deficits from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined. I tell you, we need a change.  How is he paying for these short-term jobs? Reagan's economic recovery is being financed by deficit spending --  200 billion dollars a year. Military spending, a major cause of this deficit, is projected over the next five years to be nearly 2 trillion dollars, and will cost about  40,000 dollars for every taxpaying family. When the Government borrows 200 billion dollars annually to finance the deficit, this encourages the private sector to make its money off of interest rates as opposed to developmentand economic growth.Even money abroad, we don't have enough money domestically to finance the debt, so we are now borrowing money abroad, from foreign banks, governments and financial institutions: 40 billion dollars in 1983;  70-80 billion dollars in 1984 -- 40 percent of our total; over 100 billion dollars -- 50 percent of our total -- in 1985. By 1989, it is projected that 50 percent of all individual income taxes will be going just to pay for interest on that debt. The United States used to be the largestexporter of capital, but under Mr. Reagan we will quite likely become the largest debtor nation.About two weeks ago, on July the 4th, we celebrated our Declaration of Independence, yet every day supply-side economics is making our nation more economically dependent and less economically free. Five to six percent of our Gross National Product is now being eaten up with President Reagan's budget deficits. To depend on foreign military powers to protect our national security would be foolish, making us dependent and less secure. Yet, Reaganomics has us increasingly dependent on foreign economic sources. This consumer-led but deficit-financed recovery is unbalanced and artificial. We have a challenge as Democrats to point a way out.Democracy guarantees opportunity, not success.Democracy guarantees the right to participate, not a license for either a majority or a minority to dominate.  The victory for the Rainbow Coalition in the Platform debates today was not whether we won or lost, but that we raised the right issues. We could afford to lose the vote; issues are non-negotiable. We could not afford to avoid raising the right questions. Our self-respect and our moral integrity were at stake. Our heads are perhaps bloody, but not bowed. Our back is straight. Wecan go home and face our people. Our vision is clear.  When we think, on this journey from slave-ship to championship, that we have gone from the planks of the Boardwalk in Atlantic City in 1964 to fighting to help write the planks in the platform in San Francisco in '84, there is a deep and abiding sense of joy in our souls in spite of the tears in our eyes. Though there are missing planks, there is a solid foundation upon which to build. Our party can win, but we must provide hope which will inspire people to struggle and achieve; provide a plan that shows a way out of our dilemma and then lead the way.In 1984, my heart is made to feel glad because I know there is a way out -- justice. The requirement for rebuilding America is justice. The linchpin of progressive politics in our nation will not come from the North; they, in fact, will come from the South. That is why I argue over and over again. We look from Virginia around to Texas, there's only one black Congressperson out of 115. Nineteen years later, we're locked out of the Congress, the Senate and the Governor's mansion. What does this large black vote mean? Why do I fight to win second primaries and fight gerrymandering and annexation and at-large [elections]. Why do we fight over that? Because I tell you, you cannot hold someone in the ditch unless you linger there with them. Unless you linger there.If you want a change in this nation, you enforce that Voting Rights Act. We'll get 12 to 20 Black, Hispanics, female and progressive congresspersons from the South. We can save the cotton, but we've got to fight the boll weevils. We've got to make a judgment. We've got to make a judgment.It is not enough to hope ERA will pass. How can we pass ERA? If Blacks vote in great numbers, progressive Whites win. It's the only way progressive Whites win. If Blacks vote in great numbers, Hispanics win. When Blacks, Hispanics, and progressive Whites vote, women win. When women win, children win. When women and children win, workers win. We must all come up together. We must come up together.Thank you.  For all of our joy and excitement, we must not save the world and lose our souls. We should never short-circuit enforcing the Voting Rights Act at every level. When one of us rise[s], all of us will rise. Justice is the way out. Peace is the way out. We should not act as if nuclear weaponry is negotiable and debatable.  In this world in which we live, we dropped the bomb on Japan and felt guilty, but in 1984 other folks [have] also got bombs. This time, if we drop the bomb, six minutes later we, too, will be destroyed. It's not about dropping the bomb on somebody. It is about dropping the bomb on everybody. We must choose to develop minds over guided missiles, and think it out and not fight it out. It's time for a change.Our foreign policy must be characterized by mutual respect, not by gunboat diplomacy, big stick diplomacy, and threats. Our nation at its best feeds the hungry. Our nation at its worst, at its worst, will mine the harbors of Nicaragua, at its worst will try to overthrow their government, at its worst will cut aid to American education and increase the aid to El Salvador; at its worst, our nation will have partnerships with South Africa. That's a moral disgrace. It's a moral disgrace. It's a moral disgrace.We look at Africa. We cannot just focus on Apartheid in Southern Africa. We must fight for trade with Africa, and not just aid to Africa. We cannot stand idly by and say we will not relate to Nicaragua unless they have elections there, and then embrace military regimes in Africa overthrowing democratic governments in Nigeria and Liberia and Ghana. We must fight for democracy all around the world and play the game by one set of rules.  Peace in this world. Our present formula for peace in the Middle East is inadequate. It will not work. There are 22 nations in the Middle East. Our nation must be able to talk and act and influence all of them. We must build upon Camp David, and measure human rights by one yard stick. In that region we have too many interests and too few friends.There is a way out -- jobs. Put America back to work. When I was a child growing up in Greenville, South Carolina, the Reverend Sample used to preach every so often a sermon relating to Jesus. And he said, If I be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto me. I didn't quite understand what he meant as a child growing up, but I understand a little better now. If you raise up truth, it's magnetic. It has a way of drawing people.With all this confusion in this Convention, the bright lights and parties and big fun, we must raise up the simple proposition: If we lift up a program to feed the hungry, they'll come running; if we lift up a program to study war no more, our youth will come running; if we lift up a program to put America back to work, and an alternative to welfare and despair, they will come working.If we cut that military budget without cutting our defense, and use that money to rebuild bridges and put steel workers back to work, and use that money and provide jobs for our cities, and use that money to build schools and pay teachers and educate our children and build hospitals and train doctors and train nurses, the whole nation will come running to us.As I leave you now, we vote in this convention and get ready to go back across this nation in a couple of days. In this campaign, I've tried to be faithful to my promise. I lived in old barrios, ghettos, and reservations and housing projects.I have a message for our youth. I challenge them to put hope in their brains and not dope in their veins. I told them that like Jesus, I, too, was born in the slum. But just because you're born in the slum does not mean the slum is born in you, and you can rise above it if your mind is made up. I told them in every slum there are two sides. When I see a broken window -- that's the slummy side. Train some youth to become a glazier -- that's the sunny side. When I see a missing brick -- that's the slummy side. Let that child in the union and become a brick mason and build -- that's the sunny side. When I see a missing door -- that's the slummy side. Train some youth to become a carpenter -- that's the sunny side. And when I see the vulgar words and hieroglyphics of destitution on the walls -- that's the slummy side. Train some youth to become a painter, an artist -- that's the sunny side.  We leave this place looking for the sunny side because there's a brighter side somewhere. I'm more convinced than ever that we can win. We will vault up the rough side of the mountain. We can win. I just want young America to do me one favor, just one favor. Exercise the right to dream. You must face reality -- that which is. But then dream of a reality that ought to be -- that must be. Live beyond the pain of reality with the dream of a bright tomorrow. Use hope and imagination as weapons of survival and progress. Use love to motivate you and obligate you to serve the human family.Young America, dream. Choose the human race over the nuclear race. Bury the weapons and don't burn the people. Dream -- dream of a new value system. Teachers who teach for life and not just for a living; teach because they can't help it. Dream of lawyers more concerned about justice than a judgeship. Dream of doctors more concerned about public health than personal wealth. Dream of preachers and priests who will prophesy and not just profiteer. Preach and dream!Our time has come. Our time has come. Suffering breeds character. Character breeds faith. In the end, faith will not disappoint. Our time has come. Our faith, hope, and dreams will prevail. Our time has come. Weeping has endured for nights, but now joy cometh in the morning. Our time has come. No grave can hold our body down. Our time has come. No lie can live forever. Our time has come. We must leave racial battle ground and come to  economic commonground and moral higher ground. America, our time has come. We come from disgrace to amazing grace. Our time has come. Give me your tired, give me your poor, your huddled masses who yearn to breathe free and come November, there will be a change because our time has come.Also in this database:Jesse Jackson - 1988 DNC AddressAlso in this database:Mario Como - 1984 DNC AddressU.S. Copyright Status:  Text = Restricted, seek permission.

Mr. Chairman, you are a strong man, and it has not been easy but we have tried as best we can to give you as much assistance as possible.Earlier today, we heard the beginning of the Preamble to the Constitution of the United States: We, the people. It's a very eloquent beginning. But when that document was completed on the seventeenth of September in 1787, I was not included in that We, the people. I felt somehow for many years that George Washington and Alexander Hamilton just left me out by mistake. But through the process of amendment, interpretation, and court decision, I have finally been included in We, the people.Today I am an inquisitor. An hyperbole would not be fictional and would not overstate the solemnness that I feel right now. My faith in the Constitution is whole; it is complete; it is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction, of the Constitution.Who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves? The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men.1 And that's what we're talking about. In other words, [the jurisdiction comes] from the abuse or violation of some public trust. It is wrong, I suggest, it is a misreading of the Constitution for any member here to assert that for a member to vote for an article of impeachment means that that member must be convinced that the President should be removed from office. The Constitution doesn't say that. The powers relating to impeachment are an essential check in the hands of the body of the Legislature against and upon the encroachments of the Executive. The division between the two branches of the Legislature, the House and the Senate, assigning to the one the right to accuse and to the other the right to judge, the framers of this Constitution were very astute. They did not make the accusers and the judgers -- and the judges the same person.We know the nature of impeachment. We've been talking about it awhile now. It is chiefly designed for the President and his high ministers to somehow be called into account. It is designed to bridle the Executive if he engages in excesses. It is designed as a method of national inquest into the conduct of public men.å_ The framers confided in the Congress the power if need be, to remove the President in order to strike a delicate balance between a President swollen with power and grown tyrannical, and preservation of the independence of the Executive.The nature of impeachment: a narrowly channeled exception to the separation-of-powers maxim. The Federal Convention of 1787 said that. It limited impeachment to high crimes and misdemeanors and discounted and opposed the term maladministration. It is to be used only for great misdemeanors, so it was said in the North Carolina ratification convention. And in the Virginia ratification convention: We do not trust our liberty to a particular branch. We need one branch to check the other.No one need be afraid -- the North Carolina ratification convention -- No one need be afraid that officers who commit oppression will pass with immunity. Prosecutions of impeachments will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, said Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, number 65. We divide into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.å_ I do not mean political parties in that sense.The drawing of political lines goes to the motivation behind impeachment; but impeachment must proceed within the confines of the constitutional term high crime[s] and misdemeanors. Of the impeachment process, it was Woodrow Wilson who said that Nothing short of the grossest offenses against the plain law of the land will suffice to give them speed and effectiveness. Indignation so great as to overgrow party interest may secure a conviction; but nothing else canmon sense would be revolted if we engaged upon this process for petty reasons. Congress has a lot to do: Appropriations, Tax Reform, Health Insurance, Campaign Finance Reform, Housing, Environmental Protection, Energy Sufficiency, Mass Transportation. Pettiness cannot be allowed to stand in the face of such overwhelming problems. So today we are not being petty. We are trying to be big, because the task we have before us is a big one.This morning, in a discussion of the evidence, we were told that the evidence which purports to support the allegations of misuse of the CIA by the President is thin. We're told that that evidence is insufficient. What that recital of the evidence this morning did not include is what the President did know on June the 23rd, 1972.The President did know that it was Republican money, that it was money from the Committee for the Re-Election of the President, which was found in the possession of one of the burglars arrested on June the 17th. What the President did know on the 23rd of June was the prior activities of E. Howard Hunt, which included his participation in the break-in of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, which included Howard Hunt's participation in the Dita Beard ITT affair, which included Howard Hunt's fabrication of cables designed to discredit the Kennedy Administration.We were further cautioned today that perhaps these proceedings ought to be delayed because certainly there would be new evidence forthcoming from the President of the United States. There has not even been an obfuscated indication that this committee would receive any additional materials from the President. The committee subpoena is outstanding, and if the President wants to supply that material, the committee sits here. The fact is that on yesterday, the American people waited with great anxiety for eight hours, not knowing whether their President would obey an order of the Supreme Court of the United States.At this point, I would like to juxtapose a few of the impeachment criteria with some of the actions the President has engaged in. Impeachment criteria: James Madison, from the Virginia ratification convention. If the President be connected in any suspicious manner with any person and there be grounds to believe that he will shelter him, he may be impeached.We have heard time and time again that the evidence reflects the payment to defendants money. The President had knowledge that these funds were being paid and these were funds collected for the 1972 presidential campaign. We know that the President met with Mr. Henry Petersen 27 times to discuss matters related to Watergate, and immediately thereafter met with the very persons who were implicated in the information Mr. Petersen was receiving. The words are: If the President is connected in any suspicious manner with any person and there be grounds to believe that he will shelter that person, he may be impeached.Justice Story: Impeachment is attended -- is intended for occasional and extraordinary cases where a superior power acting for the whole people is put into operation to protect their rights and rescue their liberties from violations. We know about the Huston plan. We know about the break-in of the psychiatrist's office. We know that there was absolute complete direction on September 3rd when the President indicated that a surreptitious entry had been made in Dr. Fielding's office, after having met with Mr. Ehrlichman and Mr. Young. Protect their rights. Rescue their liberties from violation.The Carolina ratification convention impeachment criteria: those are impeachable who behave amiss or betray their public trust.4 Beginning shortly after the Watergate break-in and continuing to the present time, the President has engaged in a series of public statements and actions designed to thwart the lawful investigation by government prosecutors. Moreover, the President has made public announcements and assertions bearing on the Watergate case, which the evidence will show he knew to be false. These assertions, false assertions, impeachable, those who misbehave. Those who behave amiss or betray the public trust.James Madison again at the Constitutional Convention: A President is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the Constitution. The Constitution charges the President with the task of taking care that the laws be faithfully executed, and yet the President has counseled his aides to commit perjury, willfully disregard the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, conceal surreptitious entry, attempt to compromise a federal judge, while publicly displaying his cooperation with the processes of criminal justice. A President is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the Constitution.If the impeachment provision in the Constitution of the United States will not reach the offenses charged here, then perhaps that 18th-century Constitution should be abandoned to a 20th-century paper shredder!Has the President committed offenses, and planned, and directed, and acquiesced in a course of conduct which the Constitution will not tolerate? That's the question. We know that. We know the question. We should now forthwith proceed to answer the question. It is reason, and not passion, which must guide our deliberations, guide our debate, and guide our decision.I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Here are centered the hopes and aspirationsand faith of the entire human race. I do not stand here as advocate for anypartisan cause, for the issues are fundamental and reach quite beyond the realmof partisan consideration. They must be resolved on the highest plane ofnational interest if our course is to prove sound and our future protected. Itrust, therefore, that you will do me the justice of receiving that which I haveto say as solely expressing the considered viewpoint of a fellow American.I address you with neither rancor norbitterness in the fading twilight of life, with but one purpose in mind: toserve my country. The issues are global and so interlocked that to consider theproblems of one sector, oblivious to those of another, is butto court disaster for the whole. While Asia is commonly referred to as theGateway to Europe, it is no less true that Europe is the Gateway to Asia, andthe broad influence of the one cannot fail to have its impact upon the other.There are those who claim our strength is inadequate to protect on both fronts,that we cannot divide our effort. I can think of no greater expression ofdefeatism. If a potential enemy can divide his strengthon two fronts, it is for us to counter his effort. The Communist threat is aglobal one. Its successful advance in one sector threatens the destruction ofevery other sector. You can not appease or otherwise surrender to communism inAsia without simultaneously undermining our efforts to halt its advance inEurope.Beyond pointing out these general truisms, Ishall confine my discussion to the general areas of Asia. Before one mayobjectively assess the situation now existing there, he must comprehendsomething of Asia's past and the revolutionary changes which have marked hercourse up to the present. Long exploited by the so-called colonial powers, withlittle opportunity to achieve any degree of social justice, individual dignity,or a higher standard of life such as guided our own noble administration in thePhilippines, the peoples of Asia found their opportunity in the war just past tothrow off the shackles of colonialism and now see the dawn of new opportunity,a heretofore unfelt dignity, and the self-respect of political freedom.Musteringhalf of the earth's population, and 60 percent of its natural resources thesepeoples are rapidly consolidating a new force, both moral and material, withwhich to raise the living standard and erect adaptations of the design of modernprogress to their own distinct cultural environments. Whether one adheres to theconcept of colonization or not, this is the direction of Asian progress andit may not be stopped. It is a corollary to the shift of the world economicfrontiers as the whole epicenter of world affairs rotates back toward the areawhence it started.In this situation, it becomes vital that ourown country orient its policies in consonance with this basic evolutionarycondition rather than pursue a course blind to the reality that the colonial era isnow past and the Asian peoples covet the right to shape their own free destiny.What they seek now is friendly guidance, understanding, and support -- notimperious direction -- the dignity of equality and not the shame of subjugation.Their pre-war standard of life, pitifully low, is infinitely lower now in thedevastation left in war's wake. World ideologies play little part in Asianthinking and are little understood. What the peoples strive for is theopportunity for a little more food in their stomachs, a little better clothingon their backs, a little firmer roof over their heads, and the realization ofthe normal nationalist urge for political freedom. These political-socialconditions have but an indirect bearing upon our own national security, but doform a backdrop to contemporary planning which must be thoughtfully consideredif we are to avoid the pitfalls of unrealism.Of more direct and immediate bearing uponour national security are the changes wrought in the strategic potential of thePacific Ocean in the course of the past war. Prior thereto the western strategicfrontier of the United States lay on the littoral line of the Americas, with anexposed island salient extending out through Hawaii, Midway, and Guam to thePhilippines. That salient proved not an outpost of strength but an avenue ofweakness along which the enemy could and did attack.The Pacific was a potential area of advancefor any predatory force intent upon striking at the bordering land areas. Allthis was changed by our Pacific victory. Our strategic frontier then shifted toembrace the entire Pacific Ocean, which became a vast moat to protect us as longas we heldit. Indeed, it acts as a protective shield for all of the Americas and all freelands of the Pacific Ocean area. We control it to the shores of Asia by a chainof islands extending in an arc from the Aleutians to the Mariannas held by usand our free allies. From this island chain we can dominate with sea and airpower every Asiatic port from Vladivostok to Singapore -- with sea and air powerevery port, as I said, from Vladivostok to Singapore -- and prevent any hostilemovement into the Pacific.*Any predatory attack from Asia must be anamphibious effort.* No amphibious force can be successful without control of thesea lanes and the air over those lanes in its avenue of advance. With naval andair supremacy and modest ground elements to defend bases, any major attack fromcontinental Asia toward us or our friends in the Pacific would be doomed tofailure.Under such conditions, the Pacific no longerrepresents menacing avenues of approach for a prospective invader. It assumes,instead, the friendly aspect of a peaceful lake. Our line of defense is anatural one and can be maintained with a minimum of military effort and expense.It envisions no attack against anyone, nor does it provide the bastionsessential for offensive operations, but properly maintained, would be aninvincible defense against aggression. Theholding of this littoral defense line in the westernPacific is entirely dependent upon holding all segments thereof; for any majorbreach of that line by an unfriendly power would render vulnerable to determined attack every other major segment.This is a military estimate as to which I have yet to find a military leader who will take exception. For that reason, I have strongly recommended in the past, as a matter of military urgency, that under no circumstances must Formosa fall under Communist control. Such an eventuality would at once threaten the freedom of the Philippines and the loss of Japan and might well force our western frontier back to the coast of California, Oregon and Washington.To understand the changes which now appearupon the Chinese mainland, one must understand the changes in Chinese characterand culture over the past 50 years. China, up to 50 years ago, was completelynon-homogenous, being compartmented into groups divided against each other. Thewar-making tendency was almost non-existent, as they still followed the tenets ofthe Confucian ideal of pacifist culture. At the turn of the century, under theregime of Chang Tso Lin, efforts toward greater homogeneity produced the start ofa nationalist urge. This was further and more successfully developed under theleadership of Chiang Kai-Shek, but has been brought to its greatest fruitionunder the present regime to the point that it has now taken on the character ofa united nationalism of increasingly dominant, aggressive tendencies.Through these past 50 years the Chinesepeople have thus become militarized in their concepts and in their ideals. Theynow constitute excellent soldiers, with competent staffs and commanders. Thishas produced a new and dominant power in Asia, which, for its own purposes, isallied with Soviet Russia but which in its own concepts and methods has becomeaggressively imperialistic, with a lust for expansion and increased powernormal to this type of imperialism.There is little of the ideological concepteither one way or another in the Chinese make-up. The standard of living is solow and the capital accumulation has been so thoroughly dissipated by war thatthe masses are desperate and eager to follow any leadership which seems topromise the alleviation of local stringencies.I have from the beginning believed that theChinese Communists' support of the North Koreans was the dominant one. Theirinterests are, at present, parallel with those of the Soviet. But I believe thatthe aggressiveness recently displayed not only in Korea but also in Indo-Chinaand Tibet and pointing potentially toward the South reflects predominantly thesame lust for the expansion of power which has animated every would-be conquerorsince the beginning of time.The Japanese people, since the war, haveundergone the greatest reformation recorded in modern history. With acommendable will, eagerness to learn, and marked capacity to understand, theyhave, from the ashes left in war's wake, erected in Japan an edifice dedicated tothe supremacy of individual liberty and personal dignity; and in the ensuingprocess there has been created a trulyrepresentative government committedto the advance of political morality, freedom of economic enterprise, and socialjustice.  Politically, economically, and socially Japanis now abreast of many free nations of the earth and will not again fail theuniversal trust. That it may be counted upon to wield a profoundly beneficialinfluence over the course of events in Asia is attested by the magnificentmanner in which the Japanese people have met the recent challenge of war, unrest, and confusion surrounding them from the outside and checked communism withintheir own frontiers without the slightest slackening in their forward progress.I sent all four of our occupation divisions to the Korean battlefront withoutthe slightest qualms as to the effect of the resulting power vacuum upon Japan.The results fully justified my faith. I know of no nation more serene, orderly, and industrious, nor in which higher hopes can be entertained for futureconstructive service in the advance of the human race.Of our former ward, the Philippines, we canlook forward in confidence that the existing unrest will be corrected and astrong and healthy nation will grow in the longer aftermath of war's terribledestructiveness. We must be patient and understanding and never fail them -- as inour hour of need, they did not fail us. A Christian nation, the Philippines stand asa mighty bulwark of Christianity in theFar East, and its capacityfor high moral leadership in Asia is unlimited.   On Formosa, the government of theRepublic of China has had the opportunity to refute by action much of themalicious gossip which so undermined the strength of its leadership on theChinese mainland. The Formosan people are receiving a just and enlightenedadministration with majority representation on the organs of government, andpolitically, economically, and socially they appear to be advancing along soundand constructive lines.With this brief insight into the surroundingareas,I now turn to the Korean conflict. While I was not consulted prior to the President's decision to intervene in support of the Republic of Korea, that decision from a military standpoint, proved a sound one, as we -- as I said, proved a sound one, as we hurled back the invader and decimated his forces. Our victory was complete, and our objectiveswithin reach, when Red China intervened with numerically superior ground forces.This created a new war and an entirely newsituation, a situation not contemplated when our forces were committed againstthe North Korean invaders; a situation which called for new decisions in thediplomatic sphere to permit the realistic adjustment of militarystrategy.Such decisions have not been forthcoming.While no man in his rightmind would advocate sending our ground forces into continental China, and suchwas never given a thought, the new situation did urgently demand a drasticrevision of strategic planning if our political aim was to defeat this new enemyas we had defeated the old.Apart from the military need, as I saw It, toneutralize thesanctuary protection given the enemy north of the Yalu, I felt that militarynecessity in the conduct of the war made necessary: first the intensification of oureconomic blockade against China; two the imposition of a naval blockade against the China coast; three removal of restrictions on air reconnaissance of China'scoastal areasand of Manchuria;  four removal of restrictions on the forces of the Republic ofChina on Formosa, with logistical support to contribute to their effective operationsagainst the common enemy.For entertaining these views, allprofessionally designed to support our forces committed to Korea and bring hostilitiesto an end with the least possible delay and at a saving of countless American and allied lives, I have been severely criticized in lay circles,principally abroad, despite my understanding that from a military standpoint theabove views have been fully shared in the past by practically every militaryleader concerned with the Korean campaign, including our own Joint Chiefs ofStaff.  I called for reinforcements but was informedthat reinforcements were not available. I made clear that if not permitted todestroy the enemy built-up bases north of the Yalu, if not permitted to utilizethe friendly Chinese Force of some 600,000 men on Formosa, if not permitted toblockade the China coast to prevent the Chinese Reds from getting succor fromwithout, and if there were to be no hope of major reinforcements, the position ofthe command from the military standpoint forbade victory.We could hold in Korea by constant maneuverand in an approximate area where our supply line advantages were in balance withthe supply line disadvantages of the enemy, but we could hope at best for onlyan indecisive campaign with its terrible and constant attrition upon our forcesif the enemy utilized its full military potential. I have constantly called forthe new political decisions essential to a solution.Efforts have been made to distort myposition. It has been said, in effect, that I was a warmonger. Nothing could befurther from the truth. I know war as few other men now living know it, andnothing to me is more revolting. I have long advocated itscomplete abolition, as its very destructiveness on both friend and foe hasrendered it useless as a means of settling international disputes. Indeed, onthe second day of September, nineteen hundred and forty-five, just following thesurrender of the Japanese nation on the Battleship Missouri, I formallycautioned as follows:Men since the beginning of time havesought peace. Various methods through theages have been attempted to devise aninternational process to prevent or settle disputes between nations. From the verystart workable methods were found in sofar as individual citizens were concerned,but the mechanics of an instrumentality oflarger international scope have neverbeen successful. Military alliances,balances of power, Leagues of Nations,all in turn failed, leaving the only path tobe  by way of the crucible of war. Theutter destructiveness of war now blocksout this alternative. We have had our lastchance. If we will not devise somegreater and more equitable system,Armageddon will be at our door. The problem basically is theological andinvolves a spiritual recrudescence and improvement of human character that willsynchronize with our almost matchlessadvances in science, art, literature, and allmaterial and cultural developments ofthe past 2000 years. It must be of the spiritif we are to save the flesh.But once war is forced upon us, there is no other alternative than to apply every available means to bring it to a swift end.War's very object is victory, not prolonged indecision.In war there isno substitute for victory.There are some who, for varying reasons, wouldappease Red China. They are blind to history's clear lesson, for history teacheswith unmistakable emphasis that appeasement but begets new and bloodier war. Itpoints to no single instance where this end has justified that means, whereappeasement has led to more than a sham peace. Like blackmail, it lays the basisfor new and successively greater demands until, as in blackmail, violencebecomes the only other alternative.Why, my soldiers asked of me, surrender militaryadvantages to an enemy in the field? I could not answer.Some may say: to avoid spread of the conflictinto an all-out war with China; others, to avoid Soviet intervention. Neitherexplanation seems valid, for China is already engaging with the maximum power itcan commit, and the Soviet will not necessarily mesh its actions with our moves.Like a cobra, any new enemy will more likely strike whenever it feels that therelativity in military or other potential is in its favor on a world-widebasis.The tragedy of Korea is further heightened bythe fact that its military action is confined to its territorial limits. Itcondemns that nation, which it is our purpose to save, to suffer the devastatingimpact of full naval and air bombardment while the enemy's sanctuaries are fullyprotected from such attack and devastation.Of the nations of the world, Korea alone, up to now, is the sole one which has risked its all against communism. The magnificence of the courage and fortitude of the Korean people defies description.  They have chosen to risk death rather than slavery. Their last words to me were: Don't scuttle the Pacific!I have just left your fighting sons in Korea.They have met all tests there, and I can report to you without reservation that they are splendid in every way.It was my constant effort to preserve them and end this savage conflict honorably and with the least loss of time and a minimum sacrifice of life. Its growing bloodshed has caused me the deepest anguish and anxiety.  Those gallant men will remain often in my thoughts and in my prayers always.I am closing my 52 years of military service.When I joined the Army, even before the turn of the century, it was thefulfillment of all of my boyish hopes and dreams. The world has turned over manytimes since I took the oath on theplain at West Point, and the hopes anddreams have longsince vanished, but I still remember the refrain of one of the most popularbarrack ballads of that day which proclaimed most proudly that old soldiersnever die; they just fade away.And like the old soldier of that ballad, I nowclose my military career and just fade away, an old soldier who tried to do hisduty as God gave him the light to see that duty.Good Bye.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,14," Martin Luther King, Jr. -- I've Been to the Mountaintop (April 3 1968) Martin Luther King, Jr.I've Been to the Mountaintop delivered 3 April 1968, Mason Temple (Church of God in Christ Headquarters), Memphis, Tennessee  );  "", ""//ia601400.us.archive.org/21/items/100-Best--Speeches/MLK19680403_64kb."");   ;Thank you very kindly, my friends. As I listened to Ralph Abernathy and his eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself, I wondered who he was talking about. It's always good to have your closest friend and associate to say something good about you. And Ralph Abernathy is the best friend that I have in the world. I'm delighted to see each of you here tonight in spite of a storm warning. You reveal that you are determined to go on anyhow.Something is happening in Memphis; something is happening in our world. And you know, if I were standing at the beginning of time, with the possibility of taking a kind of general and panoramic view of the whole of human history up to now, and the Almighty said to me, Martin Luther King, which age would you like to live in? I would take my mental flight by Egypt and I would watch God's children in their magnificent trek from the dark dungeons of Egypt through, or rather across the Red Sea, through the wilderness on toward the promised land. And in spite of its magnificence, I wouldn't stop there.I would move on by Greece and take my mind to Mount Olympus. And I would see Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Euripides and Aristophanes assembled around the Parthenon. And I would watch them around the Parthenon as they discussed the great and eternal issues of reality. But I wouldn't stop there.I would go on, even to the great heyday of the Roman Empire. And I would see developments around there, through various emperors and leaders. But I wouldn't stop there.I would even come up to the day of the Renaissance, and get a quick picture of all that the Renaissance did for the cultural and aesthetic life of man. But I wouldn't stop there.I would even go by the way that the man for whom I am named had his habitat. And I would watch Martin Luther as he tacked his ninety-five theses on the door at the church of Wittenberg.But I wouldn't stop there.I would come on up even to 1863, and watch a vacillating President by the name of Abraham Lincoln finally come to the conclusion that he had to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. But I wouldn't stop there.I would even come up to the early thirties, and see a man grappling with the problems of the bankruptcy of his nation. And come with an eloquent cry that we have nothing to fear but fear itself.But I wouldn't stop there.Strangely enough, I would turn to the Almighty, and say, If you allow me to live just a few years in the second half of the 20th century, I will be happy.Now that's a strange statement to make, because the world is all messed up. The nation is sick. Trouble is in the land; confusion all around. That's a strange statement. But I know, somehow, that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. And I see God working in this period of the twentieth century in a way that men, in some strange way, are responding. Something is happening in our world. The masses of people are rising up. And wherever they are assembled today, whether they are in Johannesburg, South Africa; Nairobi, Kenya; Accra, Ghana; New York City; Atlanta, Georgia; Jackson, Mississippi; or Memphis, Tennessee -- thecry is always the same: We want to be free.And another reason that I'm happy to live in this period is that we have been forced to a point where we are going to have to grapple with the problems that men have been trying to grapple with through history, but the demands didn't force them to do it. Survival demands that we grapple with them. Men, for years now, have been talking about war and peace. But now, no longer can they just talk about it. It is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence in this world; it's nonviolence or nonexistence. That is where we are today.And also in the human rights revolution, if something isn't done, and done in a hurry, to bring the colored peoples of the world out of their long years of poverty, their long years of hurt and neglect, the whole world is doomed. Now, I'm just happy that God has allowed me to live in this period to see what is unfolding. And I'm happy that He's allowed me to be in Memphis.I can remember -- I can remember when Negroes were just going around as Ralph has said, so often, scratching where they didn't itch, and laughing when they were not tickled. But that day is all over. We mean business now, and we are determined to gain our rightful place in God's world.And that's all this whole thing is about. We aren't engaged in any negative protest and in any negative arguments with anybody. We are saying that we are determined to be men. We are determined to be people. We are saying -- We are saying that we are God's children. And that we are God's children, we don't have to live like we are forced to live.Now, what does all of this mean in this great period of history? It means that we've got to stay together. We've got to stay together and maintain unity. You know, whenever Pharaoh wanted to prolong the period of slavery in Egypt, he had a favorite, favorite formula for doing it. What was that? He kept the slaves fighting among themselves. But whenever the slaves get together, something happens in Pharaoh's court, and he cannot hold the slaves in slavery. When the slaves get together, that's the beginning of getting out of slavery. Now let us maintain unity.Secondly, let us keep the issues where they are. The issue is injustice. The issue is the refusal of Memphis to be fair and honest in its dealings with its public servants, who happen to be sanitation workers. Now, we've got to keep attention on that. That's always the problem with a little violence. You know what happened the other day, and the press dealt only with the window-breaking. I read the articles. They very seldom got around to mentioning the fact that one thousand, three hundred sanitation workers are on strike, and that Memphis is not being fair to them, and that Mayor Loeb is in dire need of a doctor. They didn't get around to that.Now we're going to march again, and we've got to march again, in order to put the issue where it is supposed to be -- and force everybody to see that there are thirteen hundred of God's children here suffering, sometimes going hungry, going through dark and dreary nights wondering how this thing is going to come out. That's the issue. And we've got to say to the nation: We know how it's coming out. For when people get caught up with that which is right and they are willing to sacrifice for it, there is no stopping point short of victory.We aren't going to let any mace stop us. We are masters in our nonviolent movement in disarming police forces; they don't know what to do. I've seen them so often. I remember in Birmingham, Alabama, when we were in that majestic struggle there, we would move out of the 16th Street Baptist Church day after day; by the hundreds we would move out. And Bull Connor would tell them to send the dogs forth, and they did come; but we just went before the dogs singing, Ain't gonna let nobody turn me around.Bull Connor next would say, Turn the fire hoses on. And as I said to you the other night, Bull Connor didn't know history. He knew a kind of physics that somehow didn't relate to the transphysics that we knew about. And that was the fact that there was a certain kind of fire that no water could put out. And we went before the fire hoses; we had known water. If we were Baptist or some other denominations, we had been immersed. If we were Methodist, and some others, we had been sprinkled, but we knew water.That couldn't stop us.And we just went on before the dogs and we would look at them; and we'd go on before the water hoses and we would look at it, and we'd just go on singing Over my head I see freedom in the air. And then we would be thrown in the paddy wagons, and sometimes we were stacked in there like sardines in a can. And they would throw us in, and old Bull would say, Take 'em off, and they did; and we would just go in the paddy wagon singing, We Shall Overcome. And every now and then we'd get in jail, and we'd see the jailers looking through the windows being moved by our prayers, and being moved by our words and our songs. And there was a power there which Bull Connor couldn't adjust to; and so we ended up transforming Bull into a steer, and we won our struggle in Birmingham. Now we've got to go on in Memphis just like that. I call upon you to be with us when we go out Monday.Now about injunctions: We have an injunction and we're going into court tomorrow morning to fight this illegal, unconstitutional injunction. All we say to America is, Be true to what you said on paper. If I lived in China or even Russia, or any totalitarian country, maybe I could understand some of these illegal injunctions. Maybe I could understand the denial of certain basic First Amendment privileges, because they hadn't committed themselves to that over there. But somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly. Somewhere I read of the freedom of speech. Somewhere I read of the freedom of press. Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for right. And so just as I say, we aren't going to let dogs or water hoses turn us around, we aren't going to let any injunction turn us around. We are going on.We need all of you. And you know what's beautiful to me is to see all of these ministers of the Gospel. It's a marvelous picture. Who is it that is supposed to articulate the longings and aspirations of the people more than the preacher? Somehow the preacher must have a kind of fire shut up in his bones. And whenever injustice is around he tell it. Somehow the preacher must be an Amos, and saith, When God speaks who can but prophesy? Again with Amos, Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. Somehow the preacher must say with Jesus, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me, and he's anointed me to deal with the problems of the poor.And I want to commend the preachers, under the leadership of these noble men: James Lawson, one who has been in this struggle for many years; he's been to jail for struggling; he's been kicked out of Vanderbilt University for this struggle, but he's still going on, fighting for the rights of his people. Reverend Ralph Jackson, Billy Kiles; I could just go right on down the list, but time will not permit. But I want to thank all of them. And I want you to thank them, because so often, preachers aren't concerned about anything but themselves. And I'm always happy to see a relevant ministry.It's all right to talk about long white robes over yonder, in all of its symbolism. But ultimately people want some suits and dresses and shoes to wear down here! It's all right to talk about streets flowing with milk and honey, but God has commanded us to be concerned about the slums down here, and his children who can't eat three square meals a day. It's all right to talk about the new Jerusalem, but one day, God's preacher must talk about the new New York, the new Atlanta, the new Philadelphia, the new Los Angeles, the new Memphis, Tennessee. This is what we have to do.Now the other thing we'll have to do is this: Always anchor our external direct action with the power of economic withdrawal. Now, we are poor people. Individually, we are poor when you compare us with white society in America. We are poor. Never stop and forget that collectively -- that means all of us together -- collectively we are richer than all the nations in the world, with the exception of nine. Did you ever think about that? After you leave the United States, Soviet Russia, Great Britain, West Germany, France, and I could name the others, the American Negro collectively is richer than most nations of the world. We have an annual income of more than thirty billion dollars a year, which is more than all of the exports of the United States, and more than the national budget of Canada. Did you know that? That's power right there, if we know how to pool it. We don't have to argue with anybody. We don't have to curse and go around acting bad with our words. We don't need any bricks and bottles. We don't need any Molotov cocktails. We just need to go around to these stores, and to these massive industries in our country, and say, God sent us by here, to say to you that you're not treating his children right. And we've come by here to ask you to make the first item on your agenda fair treatment, where God's children are concerned. Now, if you are not prepared to do that, we do have an agenda that we must follow. And our agenda calls for withdrawing economic support from you.And so, as a result of this, we are asking you tonight, to go out and tell your neighbors not to buy Coca-Cola in Memphis. Go by and tell them not to buy Sealtest milk. Tell them not to buy -- what is the other bread? -- Wonder Bread. And what is the other bread company, Jesse? Tell them not to buy Hart's bread. As Jesse Jackson has said, up to now, only the garbage men have been feeling pain; now we must kind of redistribute the pain. We are choosing these companies because they haven't been fair in their hiring policies; and we are choosing them because they can begin the process of saying they are going to support the needs and the rights of these men who are on strike. And then they can move on town -- downtown and tell Mayor Loeb to do what is right.But not only that, we've got to strengthen black institutions. I call upon you to take your money out of the banks downtown and deposit your money in Tri-State Bank. We want a bank-in movement in Memphis. Go by the savings and loan association. I'm not asking you something that we don't do ourselves at SCLC. Judge Hooks and others will tell you that we have an account here in the savings and loan association from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. We are telling you to follow what we are doing. Put your money there. You have six or seven black insurance companies here in the city of Memphis. Take out your insurance there. We want to have an insurance-in.Now these are some practical things that we can do. We begin the process of building a greater economic base. And at the same time, we are putting pressure where it really hurts. I ask you to follow through here. Now, let me say as I move to my conclusion that we've got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end. Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in Memphis. We've got to see it through. And when we have our march, you need to be there. If it means leaving work, if it means leaving school -- be there. Be concerned about your brother. You may not be on strike. But either we go up together, or we go down together.Let us develop a kind of dangerous unselfishness. One day a man came to Jesus, and he wanted to raise some questions about some vital matters of life. At points he wanted to trick Jesus, and show him that he knew a little more than Jesus knew and throw him off base....Now that question could have easily ended up in a philosophical and theological debate. But Jesus immediately pulled that question from mid-air, and placed it on a dangerous curve between Jerusalem and Jericho. And he talked about a certain man, who fell among thieves. You remember that a Levite and a priest passed by on the other side. They didn't stop to help him. And finally a man of another race came by. He got down from his beast, decided not to be compassionate by proxy. But he got down with him, administered first aid, and helped theman in need. Jesus ended up saying, this was the good man, this was the great man, because he had the capacity to project the I into the thou, and to be concerned about his brother.Now you know, we use our imagination a great deal to try to determine why the priest and the Levite didn't stop. At times we say they were busy going to a church meeting, an ecclesiastical gathering, and they had to get on down to Jerusalem so they wouldn't be late for their meeting. At other times we would speculate that there was a religious law that One who was engaged in religious ceremonials was not to touch a human body twenty-four hours before the ceremony. And every now and then we begin to wonder whether maybe they were not going down to Jerusalem -- or down to Jericho, rather to organize a Jericho Road Improvement Association. That's a possibility. Maybe they felt that it was better to deal with the problem from the causal root, rather than to get bogged down with an individual effect.But I'm going to tell you what my imagination tells me. It's possible that those men were afraid. You see, the Jericho road is a dangerous road. I remember when Mrs. King and I were first in Jerusalem. We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem down to Jericho. And as soon as we got on that road, I said to my wife, I can see why Jesus used this as the setting for his parable. It's a winding, meandering road. It's really conducive for ambushing. You start out in Jerusalem, which is about 1200 miles -- or rather 1200 feet above sea level. And by the time you get down to Jericho, fifteen or twenty minutes later, you're about 2200 feet below sea level. That's a dangerous road. In the days of Jesus it came to be known as the Bloody Pass. And you know, it's possible that the priest and the Levite looked over that man on the ground and wondered if the robbers were still around. Or it's possible that they felt that the man on the ground was merely faking. And he was acting like he had been robbed and hurt, in order to seize them over there, lure them there for quick and easy seizure. And so the first question that the priest asked -- the first question that the Levite asked was, If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me? But then the Good Samaritan came by. And he reversed the question: If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?That's the question before you tonight. Not, If I stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to my job. Not, If I stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to all of the hours that I usually spend in my office every day and every week as a pastor? The question is not, If I stop to help this man in need, what will happen to me? The question is, If I do not stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to them? That's the question.Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness. Let us stand with a greater determination. And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make America what it ought to be. We have an opportunity to make America a better nation. And I want to thank God, once more, for allowing me to be here with you.You know, several years ago, I was in New York City autographing the first book that I had written. And while sitting there autographing books, a demented black woman came up. The only question I heard from her was, Are you Martin Luther King? And I was looking down writing, and I said, Yes. And the next minute I felt something beating on my chest. Before I knew it I had been stabbed by this demented woman. I was rushed to Harlem Hospital. It was a dark Saturday afternoon. And that blade had gone through, and the X-rays revealed that the tip of the blade was on the edge of my aorta, the main artery. And once that's punctured, your drowned in your own blood -- that's the end of you.It came out in the New York Times the next morning, that if I had merely sneezed, I would have died. Well, about four days later, they allowed me, after the operation, after my chest had been opened, and the blade had been taken out, to move around in the wheel chair in the hospital. They allowed me to read some of the mail that came in, and from all over the states and the world, kind letters came in. I read a few, but one of them I will never forget. I had received one from the President and the Vice-President. I've forgotten what those telegrams said. I'd received a visit and a letter from the Governor of New York, but I've forgotten what that letter said. But there was another letter that came from a little girl, a young girl who was a student at the White Plains High School. And I looked at that letter, and I'll never forget it. It said simply, Dear Dr. King,I am a ninth-grade student at the White Plains High School. And she said, While it should not matter, I would like to mention that I'm a white girl. I read in the paper of your misfortune, and of your suffering. And I read that if you had sneezed, you would have died. And I'm simply writing you to say that I'm so happy that you didn't sneeze.And I want to say tonight -- I want to say tonight that I too am happy that I didn't sneeze. Because if I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around here in 1960, when students all over the South started sitting-in at lunch counters. And I knew that as they were sitting in, they were really standing up for the best in the American dream, and taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around here in 1961, when we decided to take a ride for freedom and ended segregation in inter-state travel.If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around here in 1962, when Negroes in Albany, Georgia, decided to straighten their backs up. And whenever men and women straighten their backs up, they are going somewhere, because a man can't ride your back unless it is bent.If I had sneezed -- If I had sneezed I wouldn't have been here in 1963, when the blackpeople of Birmingham, Alabama, aroused the conscience of this nation, and brought into being the Civil Rights Bill.If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have had a chance later that year, in August, to try to tell America about a dream that I had had.If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been down in Selma, Alabama, to see the great Movement there.If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been in Memphis to see a community rally around those brothers and sisters who are suffering. I'm so happy that I didn't sneeze.And they were telling me --. Now, it doesn't matter, now. It really doesn't matter what happens now. I left Atlanta this morning, and as we got started on the plane, there were six of us. The pilot said over the public address system, We are sorry for the delay, but we have Dr. Martin Luther King on the plane. And to be sure that all of the bags were checked, and to be sure that nothing would be wrong with on the plane, we had to check out everything carefully. And we've had the plane protected and guarded all night.And then I got into Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now,because I've been to the mountaintop.And I don't mind.Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you.

",,,15,"Theodore Roosevelt - The Man with the Muck-rakeTheodore RooseveltTheMan with the Muck-rake delivered 14 April 1906 for flashOver a century ago Washington laid the corner stone of the Capitol in what was then little more than a tract of wooded wilderness here beside the Potomac. We now find it necessary to provide by great additional buildings for the business of the government.This growth in the need for the housing of the government is but a proof and example of the way in which the nation has grown and the sphere of action of the national government has grown. We now administer the affairs of a nation in which the extraordinary growth of population has been outstripped by the growth of wealth in complex interests. The material problems that face us today are not such as they were in Washington's time, but the underlying facts of human nature are the same now as they were then. Under altered external form we war with the same tendencies toward evil that were evident in Washington's time, and are helped by the same tendencies for good. It is about some of these that I wish to say a word today.In Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress you may recall the description of the Man with the Muck Rake, the man who could look no way but downward, with the muck rake in his hand; who was offered a celestial crown for his muck rake, but who would neither look up nor regard the crown he was offered, but continued to rake to himself the filth of the floor.In Pilgrim's Progress the Man with the Muck Rake is set forth as the example of him whose vision is fixed on carnal instead of spiritual things. Yet he also typifies the man who in this life consistently refuses to see aught that is lofty, and fixes his eyes with solemn intentness only on that which is vile and debasing.Now, it is very necessary that we should not flinch from seeing what is vile and debasing. There is filth on the floor, and it must be scraped up with the muck rake; and there are times and places where this service is the most needed of all the services that can be performed. But the man who never does anything else, who never thinks or speaks or writes, save of his feats with the muck rake, speedily becomes, not a help but one of the most potent forces for evil.There are in the body politic, economic and social, many and grave evils, and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them. There should be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil man, whether politician or business man, every evil practice, whether in politics, business, or social life. I hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker, every man who, on the platform or in a book, magazine, or newspaper, with merciless severity makes such attack, provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful.The liar is no whit better than the thief, and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves. It puts a premium upon knavery untruthfully to attack an honest man, or even with hysterical exaggeration to assail a bad man with untruth.An epidemic of indiscriminate assault upon character does no good, but very great harm. The soul of every scoundrel is gladdened whenever an honest man is assailed, or even when a scoundrel is untruthfully assailed.Now, it is easy to twist out of shape what I have just said, easy to affect to misunderstand it, and if it is slurred over in repetition not difficult really to misunderstand it. Some persons are sincerely incapable of understanding that to denounce mud slinging does not mean the endorsement of whitewashing; and both the interested individuals who need whitewashing and those others who practice mud slinging like to encourage such confusion of ideas.One of the chief counts against those who make indiscriminate assault upon men in business or men in public life is that they invite a reaction which is sure to tell powerfully in favor of the unscrupulous scoundrel who really ought to be attacked, who ought to be exposed, who ought, if possible, to be put in the penitentiary. If Aristides is praised overmuch as just, people get tired of hearing it; and over-censure of the unjust finally and from similar reasons results in their favor.Any excess is almost sure to invite a reaction; and, unfortunately, the reactions instead of taking the form of punishment of those guilty of the excess, is apt to take the form either of punishment of the unoffending or of giving immunity, and even strength, to offenders. The effort to make financial or political profit out of the destruction of character can only result in public calamity. Gross and reckless assaults on character, whether on the stump or in newspaper, magazine, or book, create a morbid and vicious public sentiment, and at the same time act as a profound deterrent to able men of normal sensitiveness and tend to prevent them from entering the public service at any price.As an instance in point, I may mention that one serious difficulty encountered in getting the right type of men to dig the Panama canal is the certainty that they will be exposed, both without, and, I am sorry to say, sometimes within, Congress, to utterly reckless assaults on their character and capacity.At the risk of repetition let me say again that my plea is not for immunity to, but for the most unsparing exposure of, the politician who betrays his trust, of the big business man who makes or spends his fortune in illegitimate or corrupt ways. There should be a resolute effort to hunt every such man out of the position he has disgraced. Expose the crime, and hunt down the criminal; but remember that even in the case of crime, if it is attacked in sensational, lurid, and untruthful fashion, the attack may do more damage to the public mind than the crime itself.It is because I feel that there should be no rest in the endless war against the forces of evil that I ask the war be conducted with sanity as well as with resolution. The men with the muck rakes are often indispensable to the well being of society; but only if they know when to stop raking the muck, and to look upward to the celestial crown above them, to the crown of worthy endeavor. There are beautiful things above and round about them; and if they gradually grow to feel that the whole world is nothing but muck, their power of usefulness is gone.If the whole picture is painted black there remains no hue whereby to single out the rascals for distinction from their fellows. Such painting finally induces a kind of moral color blindness; and people affected by it come to the conclusion that no man is really black, and no man really white, but they are all gray.In other words, they neither believe in the truth of the attack, nor in the honesty of the man who is attacked; they grow as suspicious of the accusation as of the offense; it becomes well nigh hopeless to stir them either to wrath against wrongdoing or to enthusiasm for what is right; and such a mental attitude in the public gives hope to every knave, and is the despair of honest men. To assail the great and admitted evils of our political and industrial life with such crude and sweeping generalizations as to include decent men in the general condemnation means the searing of the public con science. There results a general attitude either of cynical belief in and indifference to public corruption or else of a distrustful inability to discriminate between the good and the bad. Either attitude is fraught with untold damage to the country as a whole.The fool who has not sense to discriminate between what is good and what is bad is well nigh as dangerous as the man who does discriminate and yet chooses the bad. There is nothing more distressing to every good patriot, to every good American, than the hard, scoffing spirit which treats the allegation of dishonesty in a public man as a cause for laughter. Such laughter is worse than the crackling of thorns under a pot, for it denotes not merely the vacant mind, but the heart in which high emotions have been choked before they could grow to fruition. There is any amount of good in the world, and there never was a time when loftier and more disinterested work for the betterment of mankind was being done than now. The forces that tend for evil are great and terrible, but the forces of truth and love and courage and honesty and generosity and sympathy are also stronger than ever before. It is a foolish and timid, no less than a wicked thing, to blink the fact that the forces of evil are strong, but it is even worse to fail to take into account the strength of the forces that tell for good.Hysterical sensationalism is the poorest weapon wherewith to fight for lasting righteousness. The men who with stern sobriety and truth assail the many evils of our time, whether in the public press, or in magazines, or in books, are the leaders and allies of all engaged in the work for social and political betterment. But if they give good reason for distrust of what they say, if they chill the ardor of those who demand truth as a primary virtue, they thereby betray the good cause and play into the hands of the very men against whom they are nominally at war.In his Ecclesiastical Polity that fine old Elizabethan divine, Bishop Hooker, wrote:He that goeth about to persuade a multitude that they are not so well governed as they ought to be shall never want attentive and favorable hearers, because they know the manifold defects whereunto every kind of regimen is subject, but the secret lets and difficulties, which in public proceedings are innumerable and inevitable, they have not ordinarily the judgment to consider.This truth should be kept constantly in mind by every free people desiring to preserve the sanity and poise indispensable to the permanent success of self-government. Yet, on the other hand, it is vital not to permit this spirit of sanity and self-command to degenerate into mere mental stagnation. Bad though a state of hysterical excitement is, and evil though the results are which come from the violent oscillations such excitement invariably produces, yet a sodden acquiescence in evil is even worse.At this moment we are passing through a period of great unrest-social, political, and industrial unrest. It is of the utmost importance for our future that this should prove to be not the unrest of mere rebelliousness against life, of mere dissatisfaction with the inevitable inequality of conditions, but the unrest of a resolute and eager ambition to secure the betterment of the individual and the nation.So far as this movement of agitation throughout the country takes the form of a fierce discontent with evil, of a determination to punish the authors of evil, whether in industry or politics, the feeling is to be heartily welcomed as a sign of healthy life.If, on the other hand, it turns into a mere crusade of appetite against appetite, of a contest between the brutal greed of the have nots and the brutal greed of the haves, then it has no significance for good, but only for evil. If it seeks to establish a line of cleavage, not along the line which divides good men from bad, but along that other line, running at right angles thereto, which divides those who are well off from those who are less well off, then it will be fraught with immeasurable harm to the body politic.We can no more and no less afford to condone evil in the man of capital than evil in the man of no capital. The wealthy man who exults because there is a failure of justice in the effort to bring some trust magnate to account for his misdeeds is as bad as, and no worse than, the so-called labor leader who clamorously strives to excite a foul class feeling on behalf of some other labor leader who is implicated in murder. One attitude is as bad as the other, and no worse; in each case the accused is entitled to exact justice; and in neither case is there need of action by others which can be construed into an expression of sympathy for crime.It is a prime necessity that if the present unrest is to result in permanent good the emotion shall be translated into action, and that the action shall be marked by honesty, sanity, and self-restraint. There is mighty little good in a mere spasm of reform. The reform that counts is that which comes through steady, continuous growth; violent emotionalism leads to exhaustion.It is important to this people to grapple with the problems connected with the amassing of enormous fortunes, and the use of those fortunes, both corporate and individual, in business. We should discriminate in the sharpest way between fortunes well won and fortunes ill won; between those gained as an incident to performing great services to the community as a whole and those gained in evil fashion by keeping just within the limits of mere law honesty. Of course, no amount of charity in spending such fortunes in any way compensates for misconduct in making them.As a matter of personal conviction, and without pretending to discuss the details or formulate the system, I feel that we shall ultimately have to consider the adoption of some such scheme as that of a progressive tax on all fortunes, beyond a certain amount, either given in life or devised or bequeathed upon death to any individual-a tax so framed as to put it out of the power of the owner of one of these enormous fortunes to hand on more than a certain amount to any one individual; the tax of course, to be imposed by the national and not the state government. Such taxation should, of course, be aimed merely at the inheritance or transmission in their entirety of those fortunes swollen beyond all healthy limits. Again, the national government must in some form exercise supervision over corporations engaged in interstate business-and all large corporations engaged in interstate business-whether by license or otherwise, so as to permit us to deal with the far reaching evils of overcapitalization.This year we are making a beginning in the direction of serious effort to settle some of these economic problems by the railway rate legislation. Such legislation, if so framed, as I am sure it will be, as to secure definite and tangible results, will amount to something of itself; and it will amount to a great deal more in so far as it is taken as a first step in the direction of a policy of superintendence and control over corporate wealth engaged in interstate commerce; this superintendence and control not to be exercised in a spirit of malevolence toward the men who have created the wealth, but with the firm purpose both to do justice to them and to see that they in their turn do justice to the public at large.The first requisite in the public servants who are to deal in this shape with corporations, whether as legislators or as executives, is honesty. This honesty can be no respecter of persons. There can be no such thing as unilateral honesty. The danger is not really from corrupt corporations; it springs from the corruption itself, whether exercised for or against corporations.The eighth commandment reads, Thou shalt not steal. It does not read, Thou shalt not steal from the rich man. It does not read, Thou shalt not steal from the poor man. It reads simply and plainly, Thou shalt not steal.No good whatever will come from that warped and mock morality which denounces the misdeeds of men of wealth and forgets the misdeeds practiced at their expense; which denounces bribery, but blinds itself to blackmail; which foams with rage if a corporation secures favors by improper methods, and merely leers with hideous mirth if the corporation is itself wronged.The only public servant who can be trusted honestly to protect the rights of the public against the misdeeds of a corporation is that public man who will just as surely protect the corporation itself from wrongful aggression.If a public man is willing to yield to popular clamor and do wrong to the men of wealth or to rich corporations, it may be set down as certain that if the opportunity comes he will secretly and furtively do wrong to the public in the interest of a corporation.But in addition to honesty, we need sanity. No honesty will make a public man useful if that man is timid or foolish, if he is a hot-headed zealot or an impracticable visionary. As we strive for reform we find that it is not at all merely the case of a long uphill pull. On the contrary, there is almost as much of breeching work as of collar work. To depend only on traces means that there will soon be a runaway and an upset.The men of wealth who today are trying to prevent the regulation and control of their business in the interest of the public by the proper government authorities will not succeed, in my judgment, in checking the progress of the movement. But if they did succeed they would find that they had sown the wind and would surely reap the whirlwind, for they would ultimately provoke the violent excesses which accompany a reform coming by convulsion instead of by steady and natural growth.On the other hand, the wild preachers of unrest and discontent, the wild agitators against the entire existing order, the men who act crookedly, whether because of sinister design or from mere puzzle headedness, the men who preach destruction without proposing any substitute for what they intend to destroy, or who propose a substitute which would be far worse than the existing evils-all these men are the most dangerous opponents of real reform. If they get their way they will lead the people into a deeper pit than any into which they could fall under the present system. If they fail to get their way they will still do incalculable harm by provoking the kind of reaction which in its revolt against the senseless evil of their teaching would enthrone more securely than ever the evils which their misguided followers believe they are attacking.More important than aught else is the development of the broadest sympathy of man for man. The welfare of the wage worker, the welfare of the tiller of the soil, upon these depend the welfare of the entire country; their good is not to be sought in pulling down others; but their good must be the prime object of all our statesmanship.Materially we must strive to secure a broader economic opportunity for all men, so that each shall have a better chance to show the stuff of which he is made. Spiritually and ethically we must strive to bring about clean living and right thinking. We appreciate that the things of the body are important; but we appreciate also that the things of the soul are immeasurably more important.The foundation stone of national life is, and ever must be, the high individual character of the average citizen.Copyright Status:  Text &amp; Image = Public domain.Top 100 American SpeechesOnline Speech Bankå© Copyright 2001-Present.

(2)]Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm only going to talk to you just for a minuteor so this evening, because I have some -- some very sad news for all of you --Could you lower those signs, please? -- I have some very sad newsfor all of you, and, I think, sad news for all of our fellow citizens,and people who love peace all over the world; and that is that Martin LutherKing was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice betweenfellow human beings. He died in the cause of that effort. In this difficultday, in this difficult time for the United States, it's perhaps well toask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in.For those of you who are black -- considering the evidence evidently isthat there were white people who were responsible -- you can be filledwith bitterness, and with hatred, and a desire for revenge.We can move in that direction as a country, in greater polarization-- black people amongst blacks, and white amongst whites, filled with hatredtoward one another. Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand, andto comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed thathas spread across our land, with an effort to understand, compassion, andlove.For those of you who are black and are tempted to fill with -- be filled with hatredand mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people,I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind offeeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a whiteman.But we have to make an effort in the United States. We have to makean effort to understand, to get beyond, or go beyond these rather difficulttimes.My favorite poem, my -- my favorite poet was Aeschylus. And he once wrote:Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forgetfalls drop by drop upon the heart,until, in our own despair,against our will,comes wisdomthrough the awful grace of God.What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in theUnited States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violenceand lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another,and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country,whether they be white or whether they be black.  So I ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for the familyof Martin Luther King -- yeah, it's true -- butmore importantlyto say a prayer for our own country, which all of us love -- a prayer forunderstanding and that compassion of which I spoke.We can do well in this country. We will have difficult times. We've had difficult times in the past, but we -- and we will have difficult times in thefuture. It is not the end of violence; it is not the end of lawlessness;and it's not the end of disorder.But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of blackpeople in this country want to live together, want to improve the qualityof our life, and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land.And let's dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago:to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world. Letus dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our country and forour people.Thank you very much.Book/CDs by Michael E.

This evening, I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell,and to share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen.Like every other -- Like every other citizen, I wish the new President, and all who will labor with him, Godspeed.I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperityfor all.Our people expect their President and the Congress to find essentialagreement on issues of great moment, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of the nation. My own relations with the Congress, which began on a remote and tenuousbasis when, long ago, a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point,have since ranged to the intimate during the war and immediate post-warperiod, and finally to the mutually interdependent during these past eight years.In this final relationship, the Congress and the Administration have,on most vital issues, cooperated well, to serve the nation good, rather than mere partisanship, and so have assured that the businessof the nation should go forward. So, my official relationship with the Congress ends in a feeling -- on my part -- of gratitudethat we have been able to do so much together.We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessedfour major wars among great nations. Three of these involved our own country. Despite these holocausts, America is todaythe strongest, the most influential, and most productive nation in the world. Understandably proud of this pre-eminence, weyet realize that America's leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches, and militarystrength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.Throughout America's adventure in free government, our basic purposeshave been to keep the peace, to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity, and integrity amongpeoples and among nations. To strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people. Any failure traceable to arrogance, or our lack of comprehension, orreadinessto sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt, both at home and abroad.Progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by theconflict now engulfing the world. It commands our whole attention, absorbsour very beings. We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheisticin character, ruthless in purpose, and insiduous [insidious] in method. Unhappily, thedanger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration. To meet it successfully,there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis,but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, andwithout complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle withliberty the stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanentpeace and human betterment.Crises there will continue to be. In meeting them, whether foreign ordomestic, great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel thatsome spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solutionto all current difficulties. A huge increase in newer elements of our defenses; development of unrealistic programsto cure every ill in agriculture; a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research -- these and many other possibilities, eachpossibly promising in itself, may be suggested as the only way to the roadwe wish to travel.But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration:the need to maintain balance in and among national programs, balance betweenthe private and the public economy, balance between the cost and hopedfor advantages, balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortablydesirable, balance between our essential requirements as a nation and theduties imposed by the nation upon the individual, balance between actionsof the moment and the national welfare of the future. Good judgment seeksbalance and progress. Lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration. The record of many decades stands as proof that our people and theirGovernment have, in the main, understood these truths and have responded to them well, in the face of threat and stress.But threats, new in kind or degree, constantly arise. Of these, I mention two only.A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment.Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.Our military organization today bears little relation to that knownof any of my predecessors in peacetime, or, indeed, by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armamentsindustry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required,make swords as well. But we can no longer risk emergency improvisationof national defense. We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry ofvast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. Weannually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all UnitedStates cooperations -- corporations.Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large armsindustry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic,political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every Statehouse, everyoffice of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need forthis development. Yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved. So is the very structureof our society.In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisitionof unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrialcomplex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power existsand will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endangerour liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted.Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshingof the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peacefulmethods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in ourindustrial-militaryposture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades. Inthis revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized,complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by,or at the direction of, the Federal government.Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowedby task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically thefountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced arevolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costsinvolved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectualcuriosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electroniccomputers. The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federalemployment,project allocations, and the power of money is ever present -- and is gravelyto be regarded.Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as weshould, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that publicpolicy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite. It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integratethese and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democraticsystem -- ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society. Another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time.As we peer into society's future, we -- you and I, and our government --must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for ourown ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannotmortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the lossalso of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survivefor all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow. During the long lane of the history yet to be written, America knows thatthis world of ours, ever growing smaller, must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate, and be, instead, aproud confederation of mutual trust and respect. Such a confederation must be one of equals. The weakest must come tothe conference table with the same confidence as do we, protected as we are by our moral, economic, and military strength.That table, though scarred by many fast frustrations -- past frustrations, cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of disarmament -- of the battlefield.Disarmament, with mutual honor and confidence, is a continuingimperative.Together we must learn how to compose differences, not with arms, but withintellect and decent purpose. Because this need is so sharp and apparent,I confess that I lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite senseof disappointment. As one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war, as one who knows that another war couldutterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years, I wish I couldsay tonight that a lasting peace is in sight.Happily, I can say that war has been avoided. Steady progress towardour ultimate goal has been made. But so much remains to be done. As a private citizen, I shall never cease to do what littleI can to help the world advance along that road.So, in this, my last good night to you as your President, I thank youfor the many opportunities you have given me for public service in war and in peace. I trust in that -- in that -- in that service you find somethings worthy. As for the rest of it, I know you will find ways to improve performance in the future.You and I, my fellow citizens, need to be strong in our faith thatall nations, under God, will reach the goal of peace with justice. May we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle, confidentbut humble with power, diligent in pursuit of the Nations' great goals.To all the peoples of the world, I once more give expression to America'sprayerful and continuing aspiration: We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may havetheir great human needs satisfied; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearnfor freedom may experience its few spiritual blessings. Those who have freedom will understand, also, its heavy responsibility;that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; and that the sources -- scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will bemade [to] disappear from the earth; and that in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteedby the binding force of mutual respect and love.Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen. I am proud todo so. I look forward to it.Thank you, and good night.Book/CDs by Michael E. Eidenmuller, Published by McGraw-Hill (2008)Also in this database:Dwight D.

",,,18," Woodrow Wilson -- This is WarWoodrow WilsonWar Message delivered 2 April 1917 for flashGentlemen of the Congress:I have called the Congress into extraordinary session because there are serious, very serious, choices of policy to be made, and made immediately, which it wasneither right nor constitutionally permissible that I should assume the responsibility of making.On the third of February last I officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government that on and after the first day ofFebruary it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports of GreatBritain and Ireland or the western coasts of Europe or any of the ports controlled by the enemies of Germany within the Mediterranean.That had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare earlier in the war, but since April of last year the Imperial Government had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea craft inconformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines mightseek to destroy, when no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care taken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their openboats.The precautions taken were meager and haphazard enough, as was proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business,but a certain degree of restraint was observed.  The new policy has swept every restriction aside.  Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character, their cargo,their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board, the vessels of friendlyneutrals along with those of belligerents.  Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, though the latter wereprovided with safe conduct through the proscribed areas by the German Government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of identity, haven been sunk withthe same reckless lack of compassion or of principle.I was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in fact be done by any government that hitherto subscribed to the humane practices of civilizednations.  International law had its origin in the attempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed upon the seas, where no nation had right of dominionand where lay the free highways of the world.  By painful stage after stage has that law been built up, with meager enough results, indeed, after all was accomplished thatcould be accomplished, but always with a clear view, at least, of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded.This minimum of right the German Government has swept aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could use at sea except these which it is impossible to employ as it isemploying them without throwing to the winds all scruples of humanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the intercourse of the world.I am not now thinking of the loss of property involved, immense and serious as that is, but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of non-combatants, men,women, and children, engaged in pursuits which have always, even in the darkest periods of modern history, been deemed innocent and legitimate.  Property can be paidfor; the lives of peaceful and innocent people cannot be.The present German submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind.It is war against all nations.American ships have been sunk, American lives taken, in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of, but the ships andpeople of other neutral and friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way.  There has been no discrimination.  The challenge is to allmankind.Each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it.  The choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and temperateness ofjudgment befitting our character and our motives as a nation.  We must put excited feeling away.  Our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physicalmight of the nation, but only the vindication of right, of human right, of which we are only a single champion.When I addressed the Congress on the twenty-sixth of February last I thought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms, our right to use the seasagainst unlawful interference, our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence.  But armed neutrality, it now appears, is impracticable.  Because submarines arein effect outlaws when used as the German submarines have been used against merchant shipping, it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the law ofnations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves against privateers or cruisers, visible craft giving chase upon the open sea.  It is common prudence insuch circumstances, grim necessity indeed, to endeavor to destroy them before they have shown their own intention.  They must be dealt with upon sight, if dealt with atall.The German Government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which it has proscribed, even in the defense of rights which nomodern publicist has ever before questioned their right to defend.  The intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have placed on our merchant ships will betreated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be.  Armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances and in the face ofsuch pretensions it is worse than ineffectual; it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rightsor the effectiveness of belligerents.  There is one choice we cannot make, we are incapable of making: we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the mostsacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated.  The wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs: they cut to the very roots ofhuman life.With a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves, but in unhesitatingobedience to what I deem my constitutional duty, I advise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial German Government to be in fact nothing less thanwar against the government and people of the United States; that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it; and that it take immediatesteps not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the Government of the GermanEmpire to terms and end the war.What this will involve is clear.It will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with  the governments now at war with Germany, and, asincident to that, the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credits, in order that our resources may so far as possible be added to theirs.It will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the mostabundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible.It will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it withthe best means of dealing with the enemyåÕs submarines.It will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the United States already provided for by law in caseof war at least five hundred thousand men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service, and also the authorization of subsequentadditional increments of equal force so soon as they may be needed and can be handled in training.It will involve also, of course, the granting of adequate credits to theGovernment, sustained, I hope, so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present generation, by well conceived taxation.I say sustained so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seems to me that it would be most unwise to base the credits which will now be necessaryentirely on money borrowed.  It is our duty, I most respectfully urge, to protect our people so far as we may against the very serious hardships and evils which would belikely to arise out of the inflation which would be produced by vast loans.In carrying out the measures by which these things are to be accomplished we should keep constantly in mind the wisdoms of interfering as little as possible inour own preparation and in the equipment of our own military forces with theduty -- for it will be a very practical duty -- of supplying the nations already at war withGermany with the materials which they can obtain only from us or by our assistance.  They are in the field and we should help them in every way to be effective there.I shall take the liberty of suggesting, through the several executive departments of thegovernment, for the consideration of your committees, measures for the accomplishment of the several objects I have mentioned.  I hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with them as having been framed after very careful thought by thebranch of the Government upon which the responsibility of conducting the war safeguarding the nation will most directly fall.While we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be very clear, and make very clear to all the world what our motives and our objects are.  Myown thought has not been driven from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months, and I do not believe that the thought of the nation hasbeen altered or clouded by them.  I have exactly the same things in mind now that I had in mind when I addressed the Senate on the twenty-second of January last; thesame that I had in mind when I addressed the Congress on the third day of February and on the twenty-sixth of February.  Our object now, as then, is to vindicate theprinciples of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the worldsuch a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles.Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of theworld is involved and the freedom of its peoples, and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments backed by organized forcewhich is controlled wholly by their will, not by the will of their people.  We have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances.  We are at the beginning of an age inwhich it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are observedamong the individual citizens of civilized states.We have no quarrel with the German people.  We have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship.  It was not upon their impulse that theirgovernment acted in entering this war.  It was not with their previous knowledge or approval.  It was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old,unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men whowere accustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools.Self-governed nations do not fill their neighbor states with spies or set the course of intrigue to bring aboutsome critical posture of affairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and make conquest.  Such designs can be successfully worked out only under cover and whereno one has the right to ask questions.  Cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression, carried, it may be, from generation to generation, can be worked out and keptfrom the light only within the privacy of courts or behind carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and privileged class.  They are happily impossible where public opinioncommands and insists upon full information concerning all the nationåÕs affairs.A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations.  No autocratic government could be trusted to keep faithwithin it or observe its covenants.  It must be a league of honor, a partnership of opinion.  Intrigue would eat its vitals away; the plottings of inner circles who could plan whatthey would and render account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart.  Only free peoples can hold their purpose and their honor steady to a common endand prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of their own.Does not every American feel that assurance has been added to our hope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks in Russia? Russia was known by those who knew it best to have been always in fact democratic at heart, in all the vital habits of her thought, in all the intimate relationships of her people that spoke their natural instinct, their habitual attitude towards life.The autocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure, long as it had stood and terrible as was the reality of its power, was not in fact Russian in origin, character, or purpose; and now it has been shaken offand the great, generous Russian people have been added in all their naÌøve majesty and might to the forces that are fighting for freedom in the world, for justice, and forpeace.  Here is a fit partner for a League of Honor.One of the things that has served to convince us that the Prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war ithas filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, ourpeace within and without, our industries and our commerce.  Indeed it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war began; and it is unhappily not a matter ofconjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industriesof the country have been carried on at the instigation, wit the support, and even under the personal direction of official agents of the Imperial Government accredited to theGovernment of the United States.Even in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most generous interpretation possible upon thembecause we know that their source lay, not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the German people towards us (who were, no doubt, as ignorant of them as we ourselveswere), but only in the selfish designs of a Government that did what it pleased and told its people nothing.  But they have played their part in serving to convince us at lastthat that Government entertains no real friendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its convenience.  That it means to stir up enemies against usat our very doors that intercepted note to the German Minister at Mexico City is eloquent evidence.We are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a government, following such methods, we can never have a friend; and that inthe presence of its organized power, always lying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there can be no assured security of the democratic governments of theworld.  We are now about to accept a gauge of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall, if necessary, spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify itspretensions and its power.We are glad, now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretense about them, to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for theliberation of its peoples, the German peoples included:  for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and ofobedience.  The world must be made safe for democracy.  Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty.  We have no selfish ends to serve.We desire no conquest, no dominion.  We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall cheerfully make.  We are but one of thechampions of the rights of mankind.  We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.Just because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing forourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feelconfident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and fair play we profess to be fighting for.I have said nothing of the governments allied with the Imperial Government of Germany because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend ourright and our honor.The Austro-Hungarian Government has, indeed, avowed its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfareadopted now without disguise by the Imperial German Government, and it has therefore not been possible for this Government to receive Count Tarnowski, the Ambassadorrecently accredited to this Government by the Imperial and Royal Government of Austria-Hungary; but that Government has not actually engaged in warfare against citizensof the United States on the seas, and I take the liberty, for the present at least, of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at Vienna.We enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means of defending our rights.It will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity towards apeople or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerationsof humanity and of right and is running amuck.We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the earlyreestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us -- however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.We have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of thatfriendship -- exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible.We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the millions of men and women ofGerman birth and native sympathy who live amongst us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it towards all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to theGovernment in the hour of test.  They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance.  They will be prompt tostand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose.  If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with a firm hand of sternrepression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance exceptfrom a lawless and malignant few.It is a distressing and oppressive duty, Gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you.  There are, it may be, many months of fiery trialand sacrifice ahead of us.  It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be inthe balance.But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts, for democracy, for the right ofthose who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert offree peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world at last free.To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that weare and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles thatgave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.  God helping her, she can do noother.Copyright Status:  Text and Image = Public domain.Top 100 American SpeechesOnline Speech Bankå© Copyright 2001-Present.

And when I replied, West Point, he remarked, Beautiful place. Have you ever been there before?No human being could fail to be deeply moved by such a tribute as this [Thayer Award]. Coming from a profession I have served so long, and a people I have loved so well, it fills me with an emotion I cannot express. But this award is not intended primarily to honor a personality, but to symbolize a great moral code -- the code of conduct and chivalry of those who guard this beloved land of culture and ancient descent. That is the animation of this medallion. For all eyes and for all time, it is an expression of the ethics of the American soldier. That I should be integrated in this way with so noble an ideal arouses a sense of pride and yet of humility which will be with me alwaysDuty,Honor, Country: Those three hallowed words reverently dictatewhat you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be. They are your rallying points: to build courage when courage seems to fail; to regain faith when there seems to be littlecause for faith; to create hope when hope becomes forlorn.Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquenceof diction, that poetry of imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor to tellyou all that they mean.The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyantphrase. Every pedant, every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every troublemaker,and I am sorry to say, some others of an entirely different character, will try todowngrade them even to the extent of mockery and ridicule.But these are some of the things theydo: They build your basic character. They mold you for your future roles as the custodiansof the nation's defense. They make you strong enough to know when you are weak, andbrave enough to face yourself when you are afraid. They teach you to be proud and unbendingin honest failure, but humble and gentle in success; not to substitute wordsfor actions, not to seek the path of comfort, but to face the stress and spur of difficulty and challenge; to learn to stand up in the stormbut to have compassion on those who fall; to master yourself before you seek to master others;to have a heart that is clean, a goal that is high; to learn to laugh, yet never forget howto weep; to reach into the future yet never neglect the past; to be serious yet never to takeyourself too seriously; to be modest so that you will remember the simplicity of true greatness,the open mind of true wisdom, the meekness of true strength. They give you a temper of thewill, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions, a freshness of the deep springsof life, a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of an appetite for adventure overlove of ease. They create in your heart the sense of wonder, the unfailing hope of whatnext, and the joy and inspiration of life. They teach you in this way to be an officer anda gentleman.And what sort of soldiers are those you are to lead? Are they reliable? Are they brave? Are they capable of victory? Their story is known to all of you. It is the story of the American man-at-arms. My estimate of him was formed on the battlefield many,many years ago, and has never changed. I regarded him then as I regard him now -- as oneof the world's noblest figures, not only as one of the finest military characters, but alsoas one of the most stainless. His name and fame are the birthright of every American citizen. Inhis youth and strength, his love and loyalty, he gave all that mortality can give.He needs no eulogy from me or from any other man. He has written his own history and written it in red on his enemy's breast. But when I think of his patience under adversity, of his courage underfire, and of his modesty in victory, I am filled with an emotion of admiration I cannot put intowords. He belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism. He belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principlesof liberty and freedom. He belongs to the present, to us, by his virtues and by his achievements.In 20 campaigns, on a hundred battlefields, around a thousand campfires, I have witnessedthat enduring fortitude, that patriotic self-abnegation, and that invincible determination whichhave carved his statue in the hearts of his people. From one end of the world to the otherhe has drained deep the chalice of courage.As I listened to those songs [of the glee club], in memory's eye I could see those staggering columns of the First World War, bending under soggy packs, on manya weary march from dripping dusk to drizzling dawn, slogging ankle-deep through the mire of shell-shocked roads, to form grimly for the attack, blue-lipped, covered with sludgeand mud, chilled by the wind and rain, driving home to their objective, and for many, to the judgment seat of God.I do not know the dignity of their birth, but I do know the gloryof their death. They died unquestioning, uncomplaining, with faith in their hearts, andon their lips the hope that we would go on to victory. Always, for them: Duty, Honor, Country; always their blood and sweat and tears, as we sought the way and the light and the truth.And 20 years after, on the other side of the globe, again the filthof murky foxholes, the stench of ghostly trenches, the slime of dripping dugouts; those boilingsuns of relentless heat, those torrential rains of devastating storms; the lonelinessand utter desolation of jungle trails; the bitterness of long separation from those they loved andcherished; the deadly pestilence of tropical disease; the horror of stricken areas of war;their resolute and determined defense, their swift and sure attack, their indomitablepurpose, their complete and decisive victory -- always victory. Always through the bloody hazeof their last reverberating shot, the vision of gaunt, ghastly men reverently followingyour password of: Duty, Honor, Country.The code which those words perpetuate embraces the highest moral lawsand will stand the test of any ethics or philosophies ever promulgated for the upliftof mankind. Its requirements are for the things that are right, and its restraintsare from the things that are wrong.The soldier, above all other men, is required to practice the greatest act of religious training -- sacrifice.In battle and in the face of danger and death,he discloses those divine attributes which his Maker gave when he created man in his own image.No physical courage and no brute instinct can take the place of the Divine helpwhich alone can sustain him.However horrible the incidents of war may be, the soldier whois called upon to offer and to give his life for his country is the noblest development ofmankind.You now face a new world -- a world of change. The thrust into outerspace of the satellite, spheres, and missiles mark the beginning of another epoch in the longstory of mankind. In the five or more billions of yearsthe scientists tell us it has taken to form the earth, in the three or more billion years of developmentof the human race, there has never been  a more abrupt or staggering evolution.We deal now not with things of this world alone, but with the illimitable distancesand as yet unfathomed mysteries of the universe. We are reaching out for a new and boundlessfrontier.We speak in strange terms: of harnessing the cosmic energy; of making windsand tides work for us; of creating unheard synthetic materials to supplement or even replaceour old standard basics; to purify sea water for our drink; of mining ocean floors for newfields of wealth and food; of disease preventatives to expand life into the hundreds of years;of controlling the weather for a more equitable distribution of heat and cold, of rainand shine; of space ships to the moon; of the primary target in war, no longer limited to the armed forces of an enemy, but instead to include his civil populations; of ultimate conflictbetween a united human race and the sinister forces of some other planetary galaxy;of such dreams and fantasies as to make life the most exciting of all time.And through all this welter of change and development, your missionremains fixed, determined, inviolable: it is to win our wars.Everything else in your professional career is but corollary to this vital dedication. All other public purposes,all other public projects, all other public needs, great or small, will find others for their accomplishment. But you are the ones who are trained to fight. Yours is the profession of arms, thewill to win, the sure knowledge that in war there is no substitute for victory; that if youlose, the nation will be destroyed; that the very obsession of your public service must be: Duty, Honor, Country.Others will debate the controversial issues, national and international,which divide men's minds; but serene, calm, aloof, you stand as the Nation's war-guardian,as its lifeguard from the raging tides of international conflict, as its gladiator in thearena of battle. For a century and a half you have defended, guarded, and protected its hallowed traditionsof liberty and freedom, of right and justice.Let civilian voices argue the meritsor demerits of our processes of government; whether our strength is being sapped by deficitfinancing, indulged in too long, by federal paternalism grown too mighty, by power groupsgrown too arrogant, by politics grown too corrupt, by crime grown too rampant, by moralsgrown too low, by taxes grown too high, by extremists grown too violent; whether ourpersonal liberties are as thorough and complete as they should be. These great national problemsare not for your professional participation or military solution. Your guidepost standsout like a ten-fold beacon in the night: Duty, Honor, Country.You are the leaven which binds together the entire fabric of our nationalsystem of defense. From your ranks come the great captains who hold the nation's destinyin their hands the moment the war tocsin sounds. The Long Gray Line has never failed us.Were you to do so, a million ghosts in olive drab, in brown khaki, in blue and gray, wouldrise from their white crosses thundering those magic words: Duty, Honor, Country.This does not mean that you are war mongers.On the contrary, the soldier,above all other people, prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest woundsand scars of war.But always in our ears ring the ominous words of Plato, that wisest of all philosophers: Only the dead have seen the end of war.1The shadows are lengthening for me. The twilight is here. My days ofold have vanished, tone and tint. They have gone glimmering through the dreams of thingsthat were. Their memory is one of wondrous beauty, watered by tears, and coaxed andcaressed by the smiles of yesterday. I listen vainly, but with thirsty ears, for the witching melody of faintbugles blowing reveille, of far drums beating the long roll. In my dreams I hear again the crashof guns, the rattle of musketry, the strange, mournful mutter of the battlefield.But in the evening of my memory, always I come back to West Point.Always there echoes and re-echoes: Duty, Honor, Country.Today marks my final roll call with you, but I want you to know thatwhen I cross the river my last conscious thoughts will be of The Corps, and The Corps, andThe Corps.I bid you farewell.Book/CDs by Michael E.

NixonThe Great Silent  Majority   delivered 3 November 1969   Audio   of Address  );  "", ""richardnixonsilentmajority1122."");   ; for flash[  fromaudio.]Good  evening, my fellow Americans.  Tonight I want to talk to you on a  subject of deep concern to all Americans and to many people in all parts  of the world, the war in Vietnam.  Ibelieve that one of the reasons for the deep division about Vietnam is that many Americans have lost confidence in what their Government has told themabout our policy. The American people cannot and should not be asked tosupport a policy which involves the overriding issues of war and peaceunless they know the truth about that policy.Tonight,therefore, I would like to answer some of the questions that I know areon the minds of many of you listening to me.Howand why did Americaget involved in Vietnamin the first place?Howhas this administration changed the policy of the previousAdministration?Whathas really happened in the negotiations in Parisand on the battlefrontin Vietnam?Whatchoices do we have if we are to end the war?Whatare the prospects for peace?Nowlet me begin by describing the situation I found when I was inauguratedon January 20:Thewar had been going on for four years. Thirty-one thousand Americans hadbeen killed in action. The training program for the South Vietnamese wasbeyond [behind] schedule. Five hundred and forty-thousand Americans were in Vietnamwith no plans toreduce the number. No progress had been made at the negotiations in Parisand the United States had not put forth acomprehensive peace proposal.Thewar was causing deep division at home and criticism from many of ourfriends, as well as our enemies, abroad.Inview of these circumstances, there were some who urged that I end the war at once by ordering the immediate withdrawal of allAmerican forces.From apolitical standpoint, this would have been a popular and easy course to follow.After all, webecame involved in the war while my predecessor was in office. Icould blame the defeat, which would be the result of my action, onhim -- and come out as the peacemaker. Someput it to me quite bluntly: Thiswas the only way to avoid allowing JohnsonåÕs war to become NixonåÕswar.ButI had a greater obligation than to think only of the years of myAdministration, and of the next election. I had to think of the effect of my decision on the nextgeneration, and on the future of peace and freedom in America, and in the world.Letus all understand that the question before us is not whether someAmericans are for peace and some Americans are against peace.The question at issue is not whether JohnsonåÕs war becomesNixonåÕs war.The greatquestion is:How can we win AmericaåÕspeace?Well,let us turn now to the fundamental issue:Why and how did the United States become involved in Vietnamin the first place?Fifteen years ago North Vietnam, with the logisticalsupport of Communist China and the Soviet Union, launched a campaignto impose a Communist government on South Vietnamby instigating andsupporting a revolution.Inresponse to the request of the Government of South Vietnam, PresidentEisenhower sent economic aid and military equipment to assist the peopleof South Vietnam in their efforts to prevent a Communist takeover. Sevenyears ago, President Kennedy sent 16,000 military personnel to Vietnamas combat advisers.Four years ago, President Johnson sent American combat forces to South Vietnam.Now many believe that President JohnsonåÕs decision to sendAmerican combat forces to South Vietnam was wrong.And many others, I among them, have been strongly critical of theway the war has been conducted.But the question facing us today is: Now that we are in the war,what is the best way to end it?In January I could only conclude that the precipitate withdrawalof all American forces from Vietnam would be a disasternot only for South Vietnam but for the United States and for the cause ofpeace.For the South Vietnamese, our precipitate withdrawal wouldinevitably allow the Communists to repeat the massacres which followedtheir takeover in the North 15 years before.They then murdered more than 50,000 people and hundreds ofthousands more died in slave labor camps.We saw a prelude of what would happen in South Vietnamwhen the Communistsentered the city of Hue last year.During their brief rule there, there was a bloody reign of terrorin which 3,000 civilians were clubbed, shot to death, and buried in massgraves.With the sudden collapse of our support, these atrocities atHuewould become thenightmare of the entire nation and particularly for the million-and-ahalf Catholic refugees who fled to South Vietnam when the Communiststook over in the North.For the United Statesthis first defeat inour nationåÕs history would result in a collapse of confidence inAmerican leadership not only in Asiabut throughout theworld.Three American Presidents have recognized the great stakesinvolved in Vietnam and understood whathad to be done.In 1963 President Kennedy with his characteristic eloquence andclarity said,We want to see a stable Government there, carrying on the[a] struggle to maintain its national independence. We believe strongly in that.We are not going to withdraw from that effort. In my opinion, for us to withdraw from that effort would mean acollapse not only of South Vietnambut Southeast Asia.So weåÕre going to stay there.å_President Eisenhower and President Johnson expressed the sameconclusion during their terms of office.For the future of peace, precipitate withdrawal would be adisaster of immense magnitude. A nation cannot remain great if it betrays its allies and letsdown its friends. Ourdefeat and humiliation in South Vietnam without questionwould promote recklessness in the councils of those great powers whohave not yet abandoned their goals of worlds conquest. This would spark violence wherever our commitments help maintainthe peace -- in the Middle East, in Berlin, eventually even inthe Western Hemisphere. Ultimately, this would cost more lives.It would not bring peace.Itwould bring more war.For these reasons I rejected the recommendation that I should end thewar by immediately withdrawing all of our forces.I chose instead to change American policy on both the negotiatingfront and the battle front in order to end the war fought on many fronts. I initiated a pursuit for peace on many fronts. In a television speech on May 14, in a speech before the UnitedNations, on a number of other occasions, I set forth our peace proposalsin great detail. We haveoffered the complete withdrawal of all outside forces within one year.We have proposed a cease fire under international supervision.We have offered free elections under international supervisionwith the Communists participating in the organization and conduct of theelections as an organized political force. And theSaigon government haspledged to accept the result of the election.We have not put forth our proposals on a take-it-or-leave-itbasis. We have indicatedthat weåÕre willing to discuss the proposals that have been put forthby the other side.We havedeclared that anything is negotiable, except the right of the people of South Vietnam to determine theirown future.At theParis peace conferenceAmbassador Lodge has demonstrated our flexibility and good faith in 40public meetings.Hanoihas refused even todiscuss our proposals.Theydemand our unconditional acceptance of their terms which are that wewithdraw all American forces immediately and unconditionally and that weoverthrow the government of South Vietnam as we leave.We have not limited our peace initiatives to public forums andpublic statements.Irecognized in January that a long and bitter war like this usuallycannot be settled in a public forum. That is why in addition to the public statements andnegotiations, I have explored every possible private avenue that mightlead to a settlement.Tonight, I am taking the unprecedented step of disclosing to yousome of our other initiatives for peace, initiatives we undertookprivately and secretly because we thought we thereby might open a doorwhich publicly would be closed.I did not wait for my inauguration to begin my quest for peace.Soon after my election, through an individual who was directly incontact on a personal basis with the leaders of North Vietnam, I made two privateoffers for a rapid, comprehensive settlement. HanoiåÕs replies called ineffect for our surrender before negotiations. Since the Soviet Union furnishes most of themilitary equipment for North Vietnam, Secretary of StateRogers, my assistant for national security affairs, Dr. Kissinger,Ambassador Lodge and I personally have met on a number of occasions withrepresentatives of the Soviet Government to enlist their assistance ingetting meaningful negotiations started. In addition, we have had extended discussions directed towardthat same end with representatives of other governments which havediplomatic relations with North Vietnam.None of these initiatives have to date produced results.In mid-July I became convinced that it was necessary to make amajor move to break the deadlock in the Paris talks. I spoke directly in this office, where IåÕm now sitting, with anindividual who had known Ho Chi Minh on apersonal basis for 25 years.Throughhim I sent a letter to Ho Chi Minh. I did this outside of the usual diplomatic channels with the hopethat with the necessity of making statements for propaganda removed,there might be constructive progress toward bringing the war to an end.Let me read from that letter to you now:Dear Mr. President:I realize that it is difficult to communicate meaningfullyacross the gulf of four years of war.But precisely because of this gulf I wanted to take thisopportunity to reaffirm in all solemnity my desire to work for a justpeace. I deeply believe that the war in Vietnam has gone on too longand delay in bringing it to an end can benefit no one, least of all thepeople of Vietnam.The time has come to move forward at the conference table towardan early resolution of this tragic war. You will find us forthcoming and open-minded in a commoneffort to bring the blessings of peace to the brave people of Vietnam. Lethistory record that at this critical juncture both sidesturned their face toward peace rather than toward conflict and war.I received Ho Chi MinhåÕs reply onAugust 30, three days before his death. It simply reiterated the public positionNorth Vietnam had taken at Paris and flatly rejectedmy initiative.The fulltext of both letters is being released to the press.In addition to the public meetings that I have referred to,Ambassador Lodge has met with VietnamåÕs chief negotiatorin Paris in 11 privatesessions. And we have taken other significant initiatives which must remainsecret to keep open some channels of communications which may stillprove to be productive.But the effect of all the public, private, and secret negotiationswhich have been undertaken since the bombing halt a year ago, and sincethis Administration came into office on January 20th, can be summed up in onesentence:No progresswhatever has been made except agreement on the shape of the bargainingtable.Well, now, whoåÕs at fault?ItåÕs become clear that the obstacle in negotiating an end to the war is not the President of the United States.It is not the South VietnameseGovernment.The obstacle is the other sideåÕs absolute refusal to show theleast willingness to join us in seeking a just peace. And it will not do so while it is convinced that all it has to dois to wait for our next concession, and our next concession after thatone, until it gets everything it wants.There can now be no longer any question that progress innegotiation depends only on Hanoi åÕs deciding tonegotiate -- to negotiate seriously. I realize that this report on our efforts on the diplomatic frontis discouraging to the American people, but the American people areentitled to know the truth -- the bad news as well as the goodnews -- where the lives of our young men are involved.Now let me turn, however, to a more encouraging report on anotherfront.At the time welaunched our search for peace, I recognized we might not succeed inbringing an end to the war through negotiations.I therefore put into effect another plan to bring peace -- a planwhich will bring the war to an end regardless of what happens on thenegotiating front. It is in line with the major shift inU. S. foreign policy whichI described in my press conference at Guam on July 25. Let me briefly explain what has been described as the NixonDoctrine -- a policy which not only will helpend the war in Vietnam but which is anessential element of our program to prevent future Vietnams.We Americans are a do-it-yourself people-- weåÕre an impatientpeople.Instead of teachingsomeone else to do a job, we like to do it ourselves.And this trait has been carried over into our foreign policy. In Korea, and again in Vietnam, the United States furnished most of themoney, most of the arms, and most of the men to help the people ofthose countries defend their freedom against Communist aggression.Before any American troops were committedto Vietnam, a leader of anotherAsian country expressed this opinion to me when I was traveling in Asia as a private citizen. He said:åÒWhen youare trying to assist another nation defend its freedom, U.S. policy should be tohelp them fight the war, but not to fight the war for them.åÓWell in accordance with this wise counsel, I laid down in Guam three principles as guidelines for future American policy toward Asia. First, the United States will keep allof its treaty commitments. Second, we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatensthe freedom of a nation allied with us, or ofa nation whose survival we consider vital to our security. Third, in cases involving other types of aggression we shallfurnish military and economic assistance when requested in accordancewith our treaty commitments.Butwe shall look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primaryresponsibility of providing the manpower for its defense.After I announced this policy, I found that the leaders of the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea,other nationswhich might be threatened by Communist aggression, welcomed this newdirection in American foreign policy.The defense of freedom is everybodyåÕs business-- not just AmericaåÕs business.And it is particularly the responsibility of the people whosefreedom is threatened.Inthe previous Administration, we Americanized the war in Vietnam.In this Administration, we areVietnamizingthe search for peace.The policy of the previous Administration not only resulted inour assuming the primary responsibility for fighting the war, but evenmore significant did not adequately stress the goal of strengthening theSouth Vietnamese so that they could defend themselves when we left.The Vietnamization plan was launchedfollowing Secretary LairdåÕs visit to Vietnam in March.Under the plan, I ordered first a substantial increase in thetraining and equipment of South Vietnamese forces. In July, on my visit to Vietnam, I changed GeneralAbramsåÕs orders, so that they were consistent with the objectives ofour new policies. Under the new orders, the primary mission of our troops is toenable the South Vietnamese forces to assume the full responsibility forthe security of South Vietnam. Our air operations have been reduced by over 20 per cent.And now we have begun to see the results of this long-overduechange in American policy in Vietnam. After five years of Americans going intoVietnam we are finallybringing American men home. ByDecember 15 over 60,000 men will have been withdrawn from South Vietnam, including 20 percentof all of our combat forces. The South Vietnamese have continued to gain in strength. As a result, they've been able to take over combatresponsibilities from our American troops.Two other significant developments have occurred since thisAdministration took office.Enemyinfiltration, infiltration which is essential if they are to launch amajor attack over the last three months, is less than 20 percent of whatit was over the same period last year. And most important, United States casualties havedeclined during the last two months to the lowest point in three years.Let me now turn to our program for the future.We have adopted a plan which we have worked out in cooperationwith the South Vietnamese for the complete withdrawal of all U.S. combat ground forcesand their replacement by South Vietnamese forces on an orderly scheduledtimetable. This withdrawal will be made from strength and not from weakness. As South Vietnamese forces become stronger, the rate of Americanwithdrawal can become greater.I have not, and do not, intend to announce the timetable for ourprogram, and there are obvious reasons for this decision which IåÕmsure you will understand.AsIåÕve indicated on several occasions, the rate of withdrawal willdepend on developments on three fronts.One of these is the progress which can be, or might be, made inthe Paris talks. An announcement of a fixed timetable for our withdrawal wouldcompletely remove any incentive for the enemy to negotiate an agreement.They would simply wait until our forces had withdrawn and thenmove in.The other two factors on which we will base our withdrawaldecisions are the level of enemy activity and the progress of thetraining programs of the South Vietnamese forces. And I am glad to be able to report tonight progress on both ofthese fronts has been greater than we anticipated when we started theprogram in June for withdrawal. As a result, our timetable for withdrawal is more optimistic nowthan when we made our first estimates in June.Now this clearly demonstrates why it is not wise to be frozen inon a fixed timetable.Wemust retain the flexibility to base each withdrawal decision on thesituation as it is at that time, rather than on estimates that are nolonger valid. Along with this optimistic estimate, I must in all candorleave one note of caution.Ifthe level of enemy activity significantly increases, we might have toadjust our timetable accordingly.However,I want the record to be completely clear on one point. At the time of the bombing halt just a year ago there was someconfusion as to whether there was an understanding on the part of theenemy that if we stopped the bombing of North Vietnam, they would stop theshelling of cities in South Vietnam.I want to be sure that there is no misunderstanding on the partof the enemy with regard to our withdrawal program.We have noted the reduced level of infiltration, the reduction ofour casualties and are basing our withdrawal decisions partially onthose factors. If the level of infiltration or our casualties increase while weare trying to scale down the fighting, it will be the result of aconscious decision by the enemy. Hanoi could make no greatermistake than to assume that an increase in violence will be to itsadvantage.If I conclude that increased enemy action jeopardizes ourremaining forces in Vietnam, I shall not hesitateto take strong and effective measures to deal with that situation. This is not a threat. Thisis a statement of policy which as Commander-in-Chief of our armed forcesI am making and meeting my responsibility for the protection of Americanfighting men wherever they may be.My fellow Americans, I am sure you can recognize from what I havesaid that we really only have two choices open to us if we want to endthis war. I can order an immediate precipitate withdrawal of all Americansfrom Vietnam without regard to theeffects of that action. Or we can persist in our search for a just peace through anegotiated settlement, if possible, or through continued implementationof our plan for Vietnamization, if necessary -- a plan in whichwe will withdraw all of our forces from Vietnam on a schedule inaccordance with our program as the South Vietnamese become strong enoughto defend their own freedom.I have chosen this second course.It is not the easy way. Itis the right way. It is aplan which will end the war and serve the cause of peace, not just in Vietnam but in the Pacificand in the world.In speaking of the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, Imentioned that our allies would lose confidence in America.Far more dangerous, we would lose confidence in ourselves. Oh, the immediate reaction would be a sense of relief that ourmen were coming home.Butas we saw the consequences of what we had done, inevitable remorse anddivisive recrimination would scar our spirit as a people.We have faced other crises in our history and we have becomestronger by rejecting the easy way out and taking the right way inmeeting our challenges.Ourgreatness as a nation has been our capacity to do what has to be donewhen we knew our course was right. I recognize that some of my fellow citizens disagree with the plan for peace I have chosen. Honest and patriotic Americans have reached different conclusions as to how peace should be achieved. In San Francisco a few weeks ago, Isaw demonstrators carrying signs reading, åÒLose in Vietnam, bring the boyshome.åÓ Well, one of the strengths of our free society is that anyAmerican has a right to reach that conclusion and to advocate thatpoint of view.But as President of the United States, I would be untrue tomy oath of office if I allowed the policy of this nation to be dictated by the minority who hold that point ofview and who try to impose it on the nation by mounting demonstrationsin the street. For almost 200 years, the policy of this nation has been made underour Constitution by those leaders in the Congress and the White Houseelected by all the people. If a vocal minority, however fervent its cause, prevails overreason and the will of the majority, this nation has no future as a freesociety.And now, I would like to address a word, if I may, to the youngpeople of this nation who are particularly concerned, and I understandwhy they are concerned, about this war.I respect your idealism.Ishare your concern for peace.Iwant peace as much as you do.Thereare powerful personal reasons I want to end this war.This week I will have to sign 83 letters to mothers, fathers, wives,and loved ones of men who have given their lives for America in Vietnam. It's very little satisfaction to me that this is only one-thirdas many letters as I signed the first week in office.There is nothing I want more than to see the day come when I donot have to write any of those letters.I want to end the war to save the lives of those brave young menin Vietnam.But I want to end it in a way which will increase the chance thattheir younger brothers and their sons will not have to fight in somefuture Vietnam some place in theworld.And I want to end the war for another reason. I want to end it sothat the energy and dedication of you, our young people, now too oftendirected into bitter hatred against those responsible for the war, canbe turned to the great challenges of peace, a better life for allAmericans, a better life for all people on this earth.I have chosen a plan for peace.I believe it will succeed.Ifit does not succeed, what the critics say now wonåÕt matter.Or if it does succeed, what the critics say now wonåÕt matter.If it does not succeed, anything I say then wonåÕt matter.I know it may not be fashionable to speak of patriotism ornational destiny these days, but I feel it is appropriate to do so onthis occasion. Two hundred years ago this nation was weak and poor. But even then, America was the hope ofmillions in the world. Today we have become the strongest and richest nation in theworld, and the wheel of destiny has turned so that any hope the worldhas for the survival of peace and freedom will be determined by whether theAmerican people have the moral stamina and the courage to meet thechallenge of free-world leadership.Let historians not record that, when America was the most powerfulnation in the world, we passed on the other side of the road and allowedthe last hopes for peace and freedom of millions of people to besuffocated by the forces of totalitarianism.So tonight, to you, the great silent majority of my fellowAmericans, I ask for your support. I pledged in my campaign for the Presidency to end the war in away that we could win the peace. Ihave initiated a plan of action which will enable me to keepthat pledge.The more support I can have from the American people, the sooner thatpledge can be redeemed. Forthe more divided we are at home, the less likely the enemy is tonegotiate at Paris.Let us be united for peace.Let us also be united against defeat. Because let us understand-- North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliatethe United States. Only Americans can do that.Fifty years ago, in this room, and at this very desk, PresidentWoodrow Wilson spoke words which caught the imagination of a war-wearyworld.He said: åÒThis is the war to end wars.åÓHis dream for peace after World War I was shattered on the hardreality of great power politics.AndWoodrow Wilson died a broken man.Tonight, I do not tell you that the war in Vietnam is the war to endwars, but I do say this: I have initiated a plan which will end this war in a way thatwill bring us closer to that great goal to which -- to which Woodrow Wilson andevery American President in our history has been dedicated -- the goal ofa just and lasting peace.As President I hold the responsibility for choosing the best pathfor that goal and then leading the nation along it.I pledge to you tonight that I shall meet this responsibilitywith all of the strength and wisdom I can command, in accordance withyour hopes, mindful of your concerns, sustained by your prayers.Thank you and good night.

(2)]I am proud to come to this city as the guest of your distinguished Mayor,who has symbolized throughout the world the fighting spirit of West Berlin.And I am proud -- And I am proud to visit the Federal Republic with your distinguished Chancellorwho for so many years has committed Germany to democracy and freedom andprogress, and to come here in the company of my fellow American, GeneralClay, who -- -- who has been in this city during its great moments of crisis andwill come again if ever needed.Two thousand years ago -- Two thousand years ago,the proudest boast was ""civis Romanus sum.""å_ Today,in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is ""Ich bin ein Berliner.""  (I appreciate my interpreter translating my German.)  There are many people in the world who really don't understand, or saythey don't, what is the great issue between the free world and the Communistworld. Let them come to Berlin.  There are some who say -- There are some who say that communism is the wave of the future.Let them come to Berlin.  And there are some who say, in Europe and elsewhere, we can work withthe Communists.Let them come to Berlin.  And there are even a few who say that it is true that communism is anevil system, but it permits us to make economic progress.Lass' sie nach Berlin kommen. Let them come to Berlin.  Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect.   But we havenever had to put a wall up to keep our people in -- to prevent them fromleaving us. I want to say on behalf of my countrymen who live many milesaway on the other side of the Atlantic, who are far distant from you, thatthey take the greatest pride, that they have been able to share with you,even from a distance, the story of the last 18 years. I know of no town,no city, that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with thevitality and the force, and the hope, and the determination of the city of West   Berlin.While the wall is the most obvious and   vivid demonstration of the failures of the Communist system -- for all the   world to see -- we take no satisfaction in it; for it is, as your Mayor   has said, an offense not only against history but an offense against   humanity, separating families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers   and sisters, and dividing a people who wish to be joined together.  What is -- What is true of this city is true of Germany: Real,   lasting peace in Europe can never be assured as long as one German out of   four is denied the elementary right of free men, and that is to make a   free choice. In 18 years of peace and good faith, this generation of   Germans has earned the right to be free, including the right to unite   their families and their nation in lasting peace, with good will to all   people.You live in a defended island of   freedom, but your life is part of the main. So let me ask you, as I close,   to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today, to the hopes of tomorrow,   beyond the freedom merely of this city of Berlin, or your country of   Germany, to the advance of freedom everywhere, beyond the wall to the day   of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind.  Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free.When all are free, then we look -- can look forward to that day when this citywill be joined as one and this country and this great Continent of Europein a peaceful and hopeful globe. When that day finally comes, as it will,the people of West Berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almosttwo decades.All -- All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin.  And, therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the   words Ich bin ein Berliner.  Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,22," Clarence Darrow -- A Plea for Mercy at the Trialof Leopold and LoebClarence DarrowA Plea forMercy delivered September 1924   for flashNow, your Honor, I have spoken about the war. I believed in it. I donåÕt know whether I was crazy or not. Sometimes I think perhaps I was. I approvedof it; I joined in the general cry of madness and despair. I urged men to fight. I was safe because I was too old to go. I was like the rest. What didthey do? Right or wrong, justifiable or unjustifiable -- which I need not discusstoday -- it changed the world. For four long years the civilized world wasengaged in killing men. Christian against Christian, barbarian uniting with Christians to kill Christians; anything to kill. It was taught in every school,aye in the Sunday schools. The little children played at war. The toddling children on the street. Do you suppose this world has ever been the samesince? How long, your Honor, will it take for the world to get back the humane emotions that were slowly growing before the war? How long will it take the calloused hearts of men before the scars of hatred and cruelty shall be removed?We read of killing one hundred thousand men in a day. We read about it and we rejoiced in it -- if it was the other fellows who were killed. We were fedon flesh and drank blood. Even down to the prattling babe. I need not tell you how many upright, honorable young boys have come into this courtcharged with murder, some saved and some sent to their death, boys who fought in this war and learned to place a cheap value on human life. Youknow it and I know it. These boys were brought up in it. The tales of death were in their homes, their playgrounds, their schools; they were in thenewspapers that they read; it was a part of the common frenzy -- what was a life? It was nothing. It was the least sacred thing in existence and theseboys were trained to this cruelty.It will take fifty years to wipe it out of the human heart, if ever. I know this, that after the Civil War in 1865, crimes of this sort increased,marvelously. No one needs to tell me that crime has no cause. It has as definite a cause as any other disease, and I know that out of the hatred andbitterness of the Civil War crime increased as America had never seen before. I know that Europe is going through the same experience today; Iknow it has followed every war; and I know it has influenced these boys so that life was not the same to them as it would have been if the world hadnot made red with blood. I protest against the crimes and mistakes of society being visited upon them. All of us have a share in it. I have mine. Icannot tell and I shall never know how many words of mine might have given birth to cruelty in place of love and kindness and charity.Your Honor knows that in this very court crimes of violence have increased growing out of the war. Not necessarily by those who fought but by thosethat learned that blood was cheap, and human life was cheap, and if the State could take it lightly why not the boy? There are causes for this terriblecrime. There are causes as I have said for everything that happens in the world. War is a part of it; education is a part of it; birth is a part of it;money is a part of it -- all these conspired to compass the destruction of these two poor boys.Has the court any right to consider anything but these two boys? The State says that your Honor has a right to consider the welfare of thecommunity, as you have. If the welfare of the community would be benefited by taking these lives, well and good. I think it would work evil that noone could measure. Has your Honor a right to consider the families of these defendants? I have been sorry, and I am sorry for the bereavement ofMr. And Mrs. Frank, for those broken ties that cannot be healed. All I can hope and wish is that some good may come from it all. But as comparedwith the families of Leopold and Loeb, the Franks are to be envied -- and everyone knows it.I do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. I hate to say it in their presence, but what is there to look forward to? I do not know butwhat your Honor would be merciful to them, but not merciful to civilization, and not merciful if you tied a rope around their necks and let them die;merciful to them, but not merciful to civilization, and not merciful to those who would be left behind. To spend the balance of their days in prison ismighty little to look forward to, if anything. Is it anything? They may have the hope that as the years roll around they might be released. I do notknow. I do not know. I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning. I know that these boys are not fit to be at large. I believethey will not be until they pass through the next stage of life, at forty-five or fifty. Whether they will then, I cannot tell. I am sure of this; that I will not be here to help them. Sofar as I am concerned, it is over.I would not tell this court that I do not hope that some time, when life and age have changed their bodies, as they do, and have changed theiremotions, as they do -- that they may once more return to life. I would be the last person on earth to close the door of hope to any human being thatlives, and least of all to my clients. But what have they to look forward to? Nothing. And I think here of the stanza ofHousman:Now hollow fires burn out to black,And lights are fluttering low:Square your shoulders, lift your packAnd leave your friends and go.O never fear, lads, naughtåÕs to dread,Look not left nor right:In all the endless road you treadThereåÕs nothing but the night.I care not, your Honor, whether the march begins at the gallows or when the gates of Joilet close upon them, there is nothing but the night, and that islittle for any human being to expect.But there are others to consider. Here are these two families, who have led honest lives, who will bear the name that they bear, and futuregenerations must carry it on.Here it LeopoldåÕs father -- and this boy was the pride of his life. He watched him, he cared for him, he worked for him; the boy was brilliant andaccomplished, he educated him, and he thought that fame and position awaited him, as it should have awaited. It is a hard thing for a father to see hislifeåÕs hopes crumble into dust.Should he be considered? Should his brothers be considered? Will it do society any good or make your life safer, or any human beingåÕs life safer, if itshould be handled down from generation to generation, that this boy, their kin, died upon the scaffold?And LoebåÕs the same. Here are the faithful uncle and brother, who have watched here day by day, while DickieåÕs father and his mother are too ill tostand this terrific strain, and shall be waiting for a message which means more to them than it can mean to you or me. Shall these be taken intoaccount in this general bereavement?Have they any rights? Is there any reason, your Honor, why their proud names and all the future generations that bear them shall have this barsinister written across them? How many boys and girls, how many unborn children will feel it? It is bad enough as it is, God knows. It is bad enough,however it is. But itåÕs not yet death on the scaffold. ItåÕs not that. And I ask your Honor, in addition to all that I have said to save two honorablefamilies from a disgrace that never ends, and which could be of no avail to help any human being that lives.Now, I must say a word more and then I will leave this with you where I should have left it long ago. None of us are unmindful of the public; courtsare not, and juries are not. We placed our fate in the hands of a trained court, thinking that he would be more mindful and considerate than a jury. Icannot say how people feel. I have stood here for three months as one might stand at the ocean trying to sweep back the tide. I hope the seas aresubsiding and the wind is falling, and I believe they are, but I wish to make no false pretense to this court. The easy thing and the popular thing to dois to hang my clients. I know it. Men and women who do not think will applaud. The cruel and thoughtless will approve. It will be easy today; but inChicago, and reaching out over the length and breadth of the land, more and more fathers and mothers, the humane, the kind and the hopeful, whoare gaining an understanding and asking questions not only about these poor boys, but about their own -- these will join in no acclaim at the death ofmy clients.These would ask that the shedding of blood be stopped, and that the normal feelings of man resume their sway. And as the days and themonths and the years go on, they will ask it more and more. But, your Honor, what they shall ask may not count. I know the easy way. I know thefuture is with me, and what I stand for here; not merely for the lives of these two unfortunate lads, but for all boys and all girls; for all of the young,and as far as possible, for all of the old. I am pleading for life, understanding, charity, kindness, and the infinite mercy that considers all. I ampleading that we overcome cruelty with kindness and hatred with love. I know the future is on my side. Your Honor stands between the past and thefuture. You may hang these boys; you may hang them by the neck until they are dead. But in doing it you will turn your face toward the past. In doingit you are making it harder for every other boy who in ignorance and darkness must grope his way through the mazes which only childhood knows. Indoing it you will make it harder for unborn children. You may save them and make it easier for every child that sometime may stand where theseboys stand. You will make it easier for every human being with an aspiration and a vision and a hope and a fate. I am pleading for the future; I ampleading for a time when hatred and cruelty will not control the hearts of men. When we can learn by reason and judgment and understanding andfaith that all life is worth saving, and that mercy is the highest attribute of man.I feel that I should apologize for the length of time I have taken. This case may not be as important as I think it is, and I am sure I do not need to tellthis court, or to tell my friends that I would fight just as hard for the poor as for the rich. If I should succeed, my greatest reward and my greatesthope will be that for the countless unfortunates who must tread the same road in blind childhood that these poor boys have trod -- that I have donesomething to help human understanding, to temper justice with mercy, to overcome hate with love.I was reading last night of the aspiration of the old Persian poet, Omar Khayyam. It appealed to me as the highest that I can vision. I wish it was inmy heart, and I wish it was in the hearts of all:So I be written in the Book of Love,I do not care about that Book above.Erase my name or write it as you will,So I be written in the Book of Love.Book/CDs by Michael E.

He thought that it was not only his duty to guide us down those rivers, and do what he was paid for doing, but to entertain us with stories curious and weird, ancient and modern strange, and familiar.  Many of them I haveforgotten, and I am glad I have, but there is one I shall never forget.The old guide was leading my camel by its halter along the banks of those ancient rivers, and he told me story after story until I grew weary of his story-telling andceased to listen.  I have never been irritated with that guide when he lost his temper as I ceased listening.  But I remember that he took off his Turkish cap and swung it in acircle to get my attention.  I could see it through the corner of my eye, but I determined not to look straight at him for fear he would tell another story.  But although I am nota woman, I did finally look, and as soon as I did he went right into another story. Said he, åÒI will tell you a story now which I reserve for my particular friends.åÓ  When he emphasized the words åÒparticular friends,åÓ I listened and I have ever beenglad I did.  I really feel devoutly thankful, that there are 1,674 young men who have been carried through college by this lecture who are also glad that I did listen.The oldguide told me that there once lived not far from the River Indus an ancient Persian by the name of Ali Hafed.  He said that Ali Hafed owned a very large farm; that he hadorchards, grain-fields, and gardens; that he had money at interest and was a wealthy and contented man.  One day there visited that old Persian farmer one of thoseancient Buddhist priests, one of the wise men of the East.  He sat down by the fire and told the old farmer how this old world of ours was made.  He said that this world was once a mere bank of fog, and that the Almighty thrust Hisfinger into this bank of fog, and began slowly to move His finger around, increasing thespeed until at last Hewhirled this bank of fog into a solid ball of fire.  Then it went rolling through the universe, burning its way through other banks of fog, and condensed themoisture without,until it fell in floods of rain upon its hot surface, and cooled the outward crust.  Then the internal fires bursting outward through the crust threw up the mountainsand hills,the valleys, the plains and prairies of this wonderful world of ours.  If this internalmolten mass came bursting out and cooled very quickly, it became granite; less quicklycopper, less quickly silver, less quickly gold, and, after gold, diamonds were made.Said the old priest, åÒA diamond is a congealed drop of sunlight.åÓ Now that is literallyscientifically true, that a diamond is an actual deposit of carbon from the sun.  The old priest told Ali Hafed that if he had one diamond the size of his thumb he could purchase the county, and if the had a mine of diamonds he could place his childrenupon thrones through the influence of their great wealth. Ali Hafed heard all about diamonds, how much they were worth, and went to his bed that night a poor man.  He had not lost anything, but he was poor because hewas discontented, and discontented because he feared he was poor.  He said, åÒI want a mine of diamonds,åÓ and he lay awake all night.Early in the morning he sought out the priest. I know by experience that a priest is very cross when awakened early in the morning, and when he shook that oldpriest out of his dreams, Ali Hafed said to him:   Will you tell me where I find diamonds?åÓ  Diamonds!  What do you want with diamonds?åÓ  åÒWhy, I wish to be immensely rich.åÓ  åÒWell, then, go along and find them.  That is all you have to do; go and findthem, and then you have them.åÓ  åÒBut I donåÕt know where to go.åÓ  åÒWell, if you will find a river that runs through white sands, between high mountains, in those white sandsyou will always find diamonds.åÓ  åÒI donåÕt believe there is any such river.åÓ  åÒOh yes, there are plenty of them.  All you have to do is to go and find them, and then you havethem.åÓ  Said Ali Hafed, åÒI will go.åÓ  So he sold his farm, collected his money, left his family in charge of a neighbor, and away he went in search of diamonds.  He began his search, very properly tomy mind, at the Mountains of the Moon.  Afterward he came around into Palestine, then wandered on into Europe, and at last when his money was all spent and he was inrags, wretchedness, and poverty, he stood on the shore of that bay at Barcelona, in Spain, when a great tidal wave came rolling in between the pillars of Hercules, and thepoor, afflicted, suffering, dying man could not resist the awful temptation to cast himself intothat incoming tide, and he sank beneath its foaming crest, never to rise in thislife again.Then after that old guide had told me that awfully sad story, he stopped the camel I was riding on and went back to fix the baggage that was coming off another camel,and I had an opportunity to muse over his story while he was gone.  I remember saying to myself, åÒWhy did he reserve that story for his åÔparticular friendsåÕ?åÓ  There seemedto be no beginning, no middle, no end, nothing to it.  That was the first story I had ever heard told in my life, and would be the first one I ever read, in which the hero waskilled in the first chapter.  I had but one chapter of that story, and the hero was dead.When the guide came back and took up the halter of my camel, he went right ahead with the story, into the second chapter, just as though there had been nobreak.  The man who purchased Ali HafedåÕs farm one day led his camel into the garden to drink, and as that camel put its nose into the shallow water of that gardenbrook, Ali HafedåÕs successor noticed a curious flash of light from the white sands of the stream.  He pulled out a black stone having an eye of light reflecting all the hues of therainbow.  He took the pebble into the house and put it on the mantel which covers the central fires, and forgot all about it.A few days later this same old priest came in to visit Ali HafedåÕs successor, and the moment he opened that drawing-room door he saw that flash of light on themantel, and he rushed up to it, and shouted:  åÒHere is a diamond!  Has Ali Hafed returned?åÓåÒOh no, Ali Hafed has not returned, and that is not a diamond.  That is nothingbut a stone we found right out here in our own garden.åÓåÒBut,åÓ said the priest, åÒI tell you I know a diamond when I see it.  I know positively that is a diamond.åÓThen together they rushed out into that old garden and stirred up the white sands with their fingers, and lo! There came up other more beautiful and valuable gemsthen the first.  åÒThus,åÓ said the guide to me, åÒwas discovered the diamond-mine of Golconda, the most magnificent diamond-mine in allthe history of mankind, excelling the Kimberly itself.  The Kohinoor, and the Orloff of the crown jewels of England and Russia, the largest on earth, came from that mine.åÓWhen that old Arab guide told me the second chapter of his story, he then took off his Turkish cap and swung it around in the air again to get my attention to themoral.  Those Arab guides have morals to their stories, although they are not always moral.  As he swung his hat, he said to me, åÒHad Ali Hafed remained at home and dugin his own cellar, or underneath his own wheat fields or in his own garden, instead of wretchedness, starvation, and death by suicide in a strange land, he would have hadåÔacres of diamonds.åÕ For every acre of that old farm, yes, every shovelful, afterward revealed gems which since have decorated the crowns of monarchs.åÓWhen he had added the moral of his story I saw why he reserved it for åÒhis particular friends.åÓ  But I did not tell him that I could see it.  It was that mean old ArabåÕsway of going around a thing like a lawyer, to say indirectly what he did not dare say directly, that åÒin his private opinion there was a certain young man then traveling downthe Tigris River that might better be at home in America.åÓ I did not tell him I could see that, but I told it to him quick, and I think I will tell it to you.I told him of a man out in California in 1847, who owned a ranch. He heard they had discovered gold in southern California, and so with a passion for gold he sold his ranch to Colonel Sutter, and away he went, never to come back. Colonel Sutter put a mill upon a stream that ran through that ranch, and one day his little girl brought some wet sand from the raceway into their home and sifted it through her fingers before the fire, and in that falling sand a visitor saw the first shining scales of real gold that were ever discovered in California. The man who had owned that ranch wanted gold, and he could have secured it for the mere taking. Indeed, thirty-eight millions of dollars has been taken out of a very few acres since then. About eight years ago I  delivered this lecture in a city that stands on that farm, and they told me that a one-third owner for years and years had been getting one hundred and twenty dollars in gold every fifteen minutes, sleeping or waking, without taxation. You and I would enjoy an income like that -- if we didnåÕt have to pay an income tax.But a better illustration really than that occurred here in our town of Pennsylvania.  If there is anything I enjoy above another on the platform, it is to get one of theseGerman audiences in Pennsylvania, and fire that at them, and I enjoy it tonight.  There was a man living in Pennsylvania, not unlike some Pennsylvanians you have seen,who owned a farm, and he did with that farm just what I should do with a farm if I owned one in Pennsylvania- he sold it.  But before he sold it he decided to secureemployment collecting coal-oil for his cousin, who was in the business in Canada, where they first discovered oil on this continent.  They dipped it from the running streamsat that early time.  So this Pennsylvania farmer wrote to his cousin asking for employment.  You see, friends, this farmer was not altogether a foolish man.  No, he wasnot.  He did not leave his farm until he had something else to do.  Of all the simpletons the stars shine on I donåÕt know of a worse one than the man who leaves one jobbefore he has gotten another.  That has especial reference to my profession, and has no reference whatever to a man seeking a divorce.  When he wrote to his cousin foremployment, his cousin replied, åÒI cannot engage you because you know nothing about the oil business.åÓWell, then the old farmer said, åÒI will know,åÓ and with most commendable zeal (characteristic of the students of Temple University) he sat himself at the study ofthe whole subject.  He began away back at the second day of GodåÕs creation when this world was covered thick and deep with that rich vegetation which since has turnedto the primitive beds of coal.  He studied the subject until he found that the drainings really of those rich beds of coal furnished the coal-oil that was worth pumping, andthen he found how it came up with the living springs.  He studied until he knew what it looked like, smelled like, tasted like, and how to refine it.  Now said he in his letter tohis cousin, åÒI understand the oil business.åÓ  His cousin answered, åÒAll right, come on.åÓSo he sold his farm, according to the county record, for $833 (even money, åÒno centsåÓ).  He had scarcely gone from that place before the man who purchased thespot went out to arrange for the watering of the cattle.  He found the previous owner had gone out years before and put a plank across the brook back of the barn, edgewiseinto the surface of the water just a few inches.  The purpose of that plank at that sharp angle across the brook was to throw over to the other bank a dreadful-looking scumthrough which the cattle would not put their noses.  But with that plank there to throw it all over to one side, the cattle would drink below, and thus that man who had goneto Canada had been himself damming back for twenty-three years a flood of coal-oil which the state geologists of Pennsylvania declared to us ten years later was even thenworth a hundred millions of dollars to our state, a thousand millions of dollars.  The man who owned that territory on which the city to Titusville now stands, and thosePleasantville valleys, had studied the subject from the second day of GodåÕs creation clear down to the present time.  He studied it until he knew all about it, and yet he issaid to have sold the whole of it for $833, and again I say, åÒno sense.åÓBut I need another illustration.  I found it in Massachusetts, and I am sorry I did because that is the state I came from.  This young man in Massachusettsfurnishes just another phase of my thought.  He went to Yale College and studied mines and mining, and became such an adept as a mining engineer that he wasemployed by the authorities of the university to train students who were behind their classes.  During his senior years he earned $15 a week for doing that work.  When hegraduated they raised his pay from $15 to $45 a week, and offered him a professorship, as soon as they did he went right home to his mother.  If they had raised that boyåÕspay from $14 to $15.60 he would have stayed and been proud of the place, but when they put it up to $45 at one leap, he said, åÒMother, I wonåÕt work for $45 a week.  Theidea of a man with a brain like mine working for $45 a week!  LetåÕs go out to California and stake out gold-mines and silver-mines, and be immensely rich.åÓSaid his mother, åÒNow, Charlie, it is just as well to be happy as it is to be rich.åÓåÒYes,åÓ said Charlie, åÒBut it is just as well to be rich and happy too.åÓ  And they were both right about it.  As he was an only son and she a widow, of course he hadhis way.  They always do.They sold out in Massachusetts, and instead of going to California they went toWisconsin, where he went into the employ of the superior Copper Mining Company at $15 a week again, but with the proviso in his contract that he should have an interest in any mines he should discover for the company.  I donåÕt believe he ever discovereda mine, and if I am looking in the face of any stockholder of that copper company you wish hehad discovered something or other.  I have friends who are not here because they could not afford a ticket, who did have stock in that company at the time this young man was employed there.  This young man went out there and I have not heard aword from him.  I donåÕt know what became of him, and I donåÕt know whether he found any mines or not, but I donåÕt believe he ever did.But I do know the other end of the line.  He had scarcely gotten the other end of the old homestead before the succeeding owner went out to dig potatoes.  Thepotatoes were already growing in the ground when he bought the farm, and as the old farmer wasbringing in a basket of potatoes it hugged very tight between the ends of the stone fence.  You know in Massachusetts our farms are nearly all stone wall.  There you are obliged to be very economical of front gateways in order to have someplace to put the stone.  When that basket hugged so tight he set it down on the ground, and then dragged on one side, and pulled on the other side, and as he wasdragging that basket though this farmer noticed in the upper and outer corner of that stone wall, right next the gate, a block of native silver eight inches square.  Thatprofessor of mines, mining, and mineralogy who knew so much about the subject that he would not work for $45 a week, when he sold that homestead in Massachusettssat right on that silver to make the bargain.  He was born on that homestead, was brought up there, and had gone back and forth rubbing the stone with his sleeve until itreflected his countenance, and seemed to say, åÒHere is a hundred thousand dollars right down here just for the taking.åÓ  But he would not take it.  It was in a home inNewburyport, Massachusetts, and there was no silver there, all away off-well, I donåÕt know were, and he did not, but somewhere else, and he was a professor ofmineralogy.My friends, that mistake is very universally made, and why should we even smile at him.  I often wonder what has become of him.  I do not know at all, but I will tellyou what I åÒguessåÓ as a Yankee.  I guess that he sits out there by his fireside to-night with his friends gathered around him, and he is saying to them something like this:åÒDo you know that man Conwell who lives in Philadelphia?åÓ  åÒOh yes, I have heard of him.åÓ åÒDo you know of that man Jones that lives in Philadelphia?åÓ  åÒYes, I have heard ofhim, too.åÓThen he begins to laugh, and shakes his sides, and says to his friends, åÒWell, they have done just the same thing I did, preciselyåÓ-and that spoils the whole joke,for you and I have done the same thing he did, and while we sit here and laugh at him he has a better right to sit out there and laugh at us.  I know I have made the samemistakes, but, of course, that does not make any difference, because we donåÕt expect the same man to preach and practice, too.As I come here to-night and look around this audience I am seeing again what through these fifty years I have continually seen å_ men that are making preciselythat same mistake.  I often wish I could see the younger people, and would that the Academy had been filled to-night with our high school scholars and ourgrammar-school scholars, that I could have them to talk to.  While I would have preferred such an audience as that,because they are most susceptible, as they have not gotten into any custom that they cannot break, they have not met with any failures as we have; and while I could perhaps do such an audience as that more good than Ican do grown-up people, yet I will do the best I can with the material I have.  I say to you that you have åÒacres of diamondsåÓ in Philadelphia right where you now live. åÒOh,åÓbut you will say, åÒyou cannot know much about your city if you think there are any åÔacres of diamondsåÕ here.åÓI was greatly interested in that account in the newspaper of the young man who found that diamond in North Carolina.  It was one of the purest diamonds that hasever been discovered, and it has several predecessors near the same locality.  I went to adistinguished professor in mineralogy and asked him where he thought those diamonds came from.  The professor secured the map of the geologic formations of our continent, and traced it.  He said it went either through the underlying carboniferousstrata adapted for such production, westward through Ohio and the Mississippi, or in more probability came eastward through Virginia and up the shore of the AtlanticOcean.  It is a fact that the diamonds were there, for they have been discovered and sold; and that they were carried down there during the drift period, from some northernlocality.  Now who can say but some person going down with his drill in Philadelphia will find some trace of adiamond-mine yet down here?  Oh, friends! You cannot say that you are not over one of the greatest diamond-mines in the world, for such a diamond as that only comes from the most profitable mines that are found on earth.But it serves to simply to illustrate my thought, which I emphasize by saying if you do not have the actual diamond-mines literally you have all that they would begood for to you.  Because now that the Queen of England has given the greatest compliment everconferred upon American woman for her attire because she did not appear with any jewels at all at the late reception in England, it has almost done away with the use of diamonds anyhow.  All you would care for would be the few youwould wear if you wish to be modest, and the rest of you would sell for money.Now then, I say again that the opportunity to get rich, to attain unto great wealth, is here in Philadelphia now, within the reach of almost every man and woman whohears me speak to-night, and I mean just what I say.  I have not come to this platform even under these circumstances to recite something to you.  I have come to tell youwhat in GodåÕs sight I believe to be the truth, and if the years of life have been of any value to me in the attainment of common sense, I know I am right; that the men andwomen sitting here, who found it difficult perhaps to buy a ticket to this lecture or gathering to-night, have within their reach åÒacres of diamonds,åÓ opportunities to get largelywealthy.  There never was a place on earth more adapted than the city of Philadelphia to-day, and never in the history of the world did a poor man without capital have suchan opportunity to get rich quickly and honestly as he has now in our city.  I say it is the truth, and I want you to accept it as such; for if you think I have come to simplyrecite something, then I would better not be here.  I have no time to waste in any such talk, but to say the things I believe, and unless some of you get richer for what I amsaying to night my time is wasted.I say that you ought to get rich, and it is our duty to get rich.  How many of my piousbrethren say to me, åÒDo you, a Christian minister, spend your time going upand down the country advising young people to get rich, to get money?åÓ  åÒYes, of course I do.åÓ  Theysay, åÒIsnåÕt that awful! Why donåÕt you preach the gospel instead ofpreaching about manåÕs making money?åÓ  åÒBecause to make money honestly is to preach the gospel.åÓ  That is thereason.  The men who get rich may be the most honestmen you find in the community. åÒOh,åÓ but says some young man here to-night, åÒI have been told all my life that if aperson has money he is very dishonest and dishonorable and mean and contemptible.åÓMy friend, that is the reason why you have none, because you have that idea of people.The foundation of your faith is altogether false.  Let me say here clearly, and say it briefly, though subject to discussion which I have not time for here, ninety-eight out of onehundred of the rich men of America are honest.  That is why they are rich.  That is why they carry on great enterprises and find plenty of people to work with them.  It is because they are honest men.Says another young man, åÒI hear sometimes of men that get millions of dollarsdishonestly.åÓ  Yes, of course you do, and so do I.  But they are so rare a thing infact that the newspapers talk about them all the time as a matter of news until you get the ideathat all the other rich men got rich dishonestly.My friend, you take and drive meå_if you furnish the auto-out into the suburbs ofPhiladelphia, and introduce me to the people who own their homes around this greatcity, those beautiful homes with gardens and flowers, those magnificent homes so lovely intheir art, and I will introduce you to the very best people in character as well asin enterprise in our city, and you know I will. A man is not really a true man until he ownshis own home, and they that own their homes are made more honorable and honest and pure, true and economical and careful, by owning the home.For a man to have money, even in large sum, is not an inconsistent thing.  We preachagainst covetousness, and you know we do, in the pulpit, and oftentimes preach against it so long and use the terms about åÒfilthy lucre: so extremely that Christians get the ideathat when we stand in the pulpit we believe it is wicked for any man to have moneyåÑuntil the collection-basket goes around, and then we almost swear at the people because they donåÕt give more money.  Oh, the inconsistency of suchdoctrines as that!Money is power, and you ought to be reasonably ambitious to have it.  You oughtbecause you can do more good with it than you could without it.  Money printed your Bible, money builds your churches, money sends your missionaries, and money paysyour preachers, and you would not have many of them, either, if you did not pay them.  I am always willing that my church should raise my salary, because the church that pays the largest salary always raises it the easiest.  You never knew anexception to it in your life. The man who gets the largest salary can do the most good with the power that isfurnished to him.  Of course he can if his spirit be right to use it for what it is given to him.I say, then, you ought to have money. If you can honestly attain unto riches inPhiladelphia, it is our Christian and godly duty to do so.  It is an awful mistake ofthese pious people to think you must be awfully poor in order to be pious.Some men say, åÒDonåÕt you sympathize with the poor people?åÓ  of course I do, or else Iwould not have been lecturing these years.  I wont give in but what I sympathize with the poor, but the number of poor who are to be with is very small.  To sympathize with a man whom God has punished for his sins, thus to help him whenGod would still continue a just punishment, is to do wrong, no doubt about it, and we do that more than we helpthose who are deserving.  While we should sympathize with GodåÕs poor-that is, those who cannot help themselves-let us remember that is not a poor person in the United Stateswho was not made poor by his own shortcomings, or by the shortcomings of some one else.  It is all wrong to be poor, anyhow.  Let us give in to that argument and pass that to one side.A gentleman gets up back there, and says, åÒDonåÕt you think there are some things in this world that are better than money?åÓ  Of course I do, but I am talking aboutmoney now.  Of course there are some things higher than money.  Oh yes, I know by the grave that has left me standing alone that there are some things in this world thatare higher and sweeter and purer than money.  Well do I know there are some things higher and grander than gold.  Love is the grandest thing on GodåÕs earth, but fortunatethe lover who has plenty of money.  Money is power, money is force, money will do good as harm.  In the hands of good men and women it could accomplish, and it hasaccomplished, good.I hate to leave that behind me.  I heard a man get up in a prayer-meeting in our city and thank the Lord he was åÒone of GodåÕs poor.åÓ  Well, I wonder what his wifethinks about that?  She earns all the money that comes into that house, and he smokes a part of that on the veranda.  I donåÕt want to see any more of the LordåÕs poor ofthat kind, and I donåÕt believe the Lord does.  And yet there are some people who think in order to be pious you must be awfully poor and awfully dirty.  That does not followat all.  While we sympathize with the poor, let us not teach a doctrine like that.Yet the age is prejudiced against advising a Christian man (or, as a Jew would say, agodly man) from attaining unto wealth.  The prejudice is so universal and the years are far enough back, I think, for me to safely mention that years ago up at Temple Universitythere was a young man in our theological school who thought he was the only pious student in that department.  He came into my office on evening and sat down by my desk, and said to me:  åÒMr. President, I think it is my duty sir, to comein and labor with you.åÓ  åÒWhat has happened now?åÓ  Said he, åÒI heard you say at the Academy, at the pierceSchool commencement, that you thought it was an honorable ambition for a young man to desire to have wealth, and that you thought it made him temperate, made him anxious to have a good name, and made him industrious.  Youspoke to make him a good man.  Sir, I have come to tell you the Holy Bible says that åÔmoney is the root of all evil.åÕåÓI told him I had never seen it in the Bible, and advised him to go out into the chapel and get the Bible, and show me the place.  So out he went for the Bible, andsoon he stalked into my office with the Bible open, with all the bigoted pride of the narrow sectarian, of one who founds his Christianity on some misinterpretation ofScripture.  He flung the Bible down on my desk, and fairly squealed into my ear:  åÒThere it is Mr. President; you can read ityourself.åÓ  I said to him: åÒWell young man, you will learn when you get a little older that you cannot trust another denomination to read the Bible for you.  You belong to another denomination.  You are taught in thetheological school, however, that emphasis is the exegesis.  Now, will you take that Bible and read it yourself, and give the proper emphasis to it?åÓHe took the Bible, and proudly read, åÒåÔThe love of money is the root of all evil.åÕåÓThen he had it right, and when one does quote aright from that same old Book he quotes theabsolute truth.  I have lived through fifty years of the mightiest battlethat old Book has ever fought, and I have lived to see its banners flying free; for never in the history of thisworld did the great minds of earth so universally agree that the Bible is true-all true-asthey do at this very hour.So I say that when he quoted right, of course he quoted the absolute truth.  åÒThe love ofmoney is the root of all evil.åÓ  He who tries to attain unto it too quickly, ordishonestly, will fall into many snares, no doubt about that.  The love of money.  What is that?  It is making an idol of money, and idolatry pure and simple every where iscondemned by the Holy Scriptures and by manåÕs common sense.  The man that worships the dollar instead ofthinking of the purposes for which it ought to be used, the man who idolizes simply money, the miser that hordes his money in the cellar, or hides it in his staking, or refuses to invest it where it will do the world good, that man whohugs the dollar until the eagle squeals has in him the root of all evil.I think I will leave that behind me now and answer the question of nearly all of you who are asking, åÒIs there opportunity to get rich in Philadelphia?åÓ  Well, now, howsimple a thing it is to see where it is, and the instant you see where it is it is yours.  Some oldgentleman gets up back there and says, åÒMr. Conwell, have you lived in Philadelphia for thirty-one years and donåÕt know that the time has gone by when you can make anythingin this city?åÓ  åÒNo, I donåÕt think it is.åÓ  åÒYes, it is; I have tried it.åÓåÒWhat business are you in?åÓ  åÒI kept a store here for twenty years, and never made a thousand dollars in the whole twenty years.åÓåÒWell, then, you can measure the good you have been to this city by what this city has paid you, because a man can judge very well what he is worth by what hereceivesåÕ that is, in what he is to the world at this time.  If you have not made over a thousand dollars in twenty years in Philadelphia, it would have been better forPhiladelphia if they had kicked you out of the city nineteen years and nine months ago.  A man has no right to keep a store in Philadelphia twenty years and notmake atleast five hundred thousand dollars, even thought it be a corner grocery-up-town.åÓYou say, åÒYou cannot make five hundred thousand dollars in a store now.åÓ  Oh, myfriends, if you will just take only four blocks around you, and find out what the peoplewant and what you ought to supply them, you would very soon see it.  There is wealthright within the sound of your voice.Some one says:  åÒYou donåÕt know anything about business.  A preacher never knows a thing about business.åÓ  Well, then I will have to prove that I am an expert.  IdonåÕt like to do this, but I have to do it because my testimony will not be taken if I am not an expert.  My father kept a country store, and if there is any place under thestars where a man gets all sorts of experience in every kind of mercantile transactions, it is in the country store.  Iam not proud of my experience, but sometimes when my father was away he would leave me in charge of the store, thought fortunately for him that was not very often.

As a matter of fact, I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks.I have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recentlyhave seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues confronting us crossparty lines. Now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of thiselection are the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has been used, We'venever had it so good.But I have an uncomfortable feeling that thisprosperity isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the future. No nation inhistory has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income. Today, 37 cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector's share, and yet ourgovernment continues to spend 17 million dollars a day more than the government takes in. Wehaven't balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years. We've raised our debt limitthree times in the last twelve months, and now our national debt is one and a half timesbigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world. We have 15 billion dollars ingold in our treasury; we don't own an ounce. Foreign dollar claims are 27.3 billion dollars. Andwe've just had announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 cents in its totalvalue.As for the peace that we would preserve, I wonder whoamong us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in SouthVietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely.Do they mean peace, or do they mean we just want to be left in peace? There can be no realpeace while one American is dying some place in the world for the rest of us. We're atwar with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from theswamp to the stars, and it's been said if we lose that war, and in so doing lose thisway of freedom of ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment that those whohad the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening. Well I think it's time we askourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the Founding Fathers.Not too long ago, two friends of mine were talking to aCuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from Castro, and in the midst of his storyone of my friends turned to the other and said, We don't know how lucky weare. And the Cuban stopped and said, How lucky you are? I had someplace toescape to. And in that sentence he told us the entire story. If we lose freedom here,there's no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth.And this idea that government is beholden to thepeople, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still thenewest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man'srelation to man. Thisis the issue of this election: whether we believe in our capacity for self-government orwhether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite ina far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.You and I are told increasingly we have to choosebetween a left or right. Well I'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a leftor right. There's only an up or down: [up] man's old -- old-aged dream, the ultimate inindividual freedom consistent with law and order, or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. And regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade ourfreedom for security have embarked on this downward course.In this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like theGreat Society, or as we were told a few days ago by the President, we mustaccept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people. But they've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves; and all of the thingsI now will quote have appeared in print. These are not Republican accusations. Forexample, they have voices that say, The cold war will end through our acceptance of a notundemocratic socialism. Another voice says, The profit motive has becomeoutmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state. Or, Our traditionalsystem of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20thcentury. Senator Fulbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution isoutmoded. He referred to the President as our moral teacher and our leader, and he says heis hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquateddocument. He must be freed, so that he can do for us what he knows is best. And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulatespokesman, defines liberalism as meeting the material needs of the masses throughthe full power of centralized government. Well, I, for one, resent it when arepresentative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of thiscountry, as the masses. This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves inAmerica. But beyond that, the full power of centralized government -- this wasthe very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don'tcontrol things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people. Andthey know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieveits purpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimatefunctions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of theeconomy.Now, we have no better example of this than government's involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years. Since 1955, the costof this program has nearly doubled. One-fourth of farming in America is responsible for85% of the farm surplus. Three-fourths of farming is out on the free market and has knowna 21% increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce. You see, that one-fourth of farming -- that's regulated and controlled by the federal government. In the last three yearswe've spent 43 dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we don't grow.Senator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater,as President, would seek to eliminate farmers. He should do his homework a little better,because he'll find out that we've had a decline of 5 million in the farm populationunder these government programs. He'll also find that the Democratic administration hassought to get from Congress [an] extension of the farm program to include that three-fourthsthat is now free. He'll find that they've also asked for the right to imprison farmerswho wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the federal government. The Secretary ofAgriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them toother individuals. And contained in that same program was a provision that would haveallowed the federal government to remove 2 million farmers from the soil.At the same time, there's been an increase in theDepartment of Agriculture employees. There's now one for every 30 farms in the UnitedStates, and still they can't tell us how 66 shiploads of grain headed for Austriadisappeared without a trace and Billie Sol Estesnever left shore.Every responsible farmer and farm organization hasrepeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy, but how -- who are farmers to know what's best for them? The wheat farmers voted against a wheat program. The government passedit anyway. Now the price of bread goes up; the price of wheat to the farmer goes down.Meanwhile, back in the city, under urban renewal theassault on freedom carries on. Private property rights [are] so diluted that public interestis almost anything a few government planners decide it should be. In a program thattakes from the needy and gives to the greedy, we see such spectacles as in Cleveland, Ohio,a million-and-a-half-dollar building completed only three years ago must be destroyed tomake way for what government officials call a more compatible use of the land.The President tells us he's now going to start building public housing units in thethousands, where heretofore we've only built them in the hundreds. But FHA [Federal Housing Authority] and theVeterans Administration tell us they have 120,000 housing units they've taken backthrough mortgage foreclosure. For three decades, we've sought to solve the problems ofunemployment through government planning, and the more the plans fail, the more theplanners plan. The latest is the Area Redevelopment Agency.They've just declared Rice County, Kansas, adepressed area. Rice County, Kansas, has two hundred oil wells, and the 14,000 peoplethere have over 30 million dollars on deposit in personal savings in their banks. And when thegovernment tells you you're depressed, lie down and be depressed.We have so many people who can't see a fat man standingbeside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by takingadvantage of the thin one. So they're going to solve all the problems of human miserythrough government and government planning. Well, now, if government planning and welfarehad the answer -- and they've had almost 30 years of it -- shouldn't we expect government toread the score to us once in a while? Shouldn't they be telling us about thedecline each year in the number of people needing help? The reduction in the need forpublic housing?But the reverse is true. Each year the need growsgreater; the program grows greater. We were told four years ago that 17 million peoplewent to bed hungry each night. Well that was probably true. They were all on a diet. Butnow we're told that 9.3 million families in this country are poverty-stricken on thebasis of earning less than 3,000 dollars a year. Welfare spending [is] 10 times greater than in thedark depths of the Depression. We're spending 45 billion dollars on welfare. Now do a littlearithmetic, and you'll find that if we divided the 45 billion dollars up equally among those 9million poor families, we'd be able to give each family 4,600 dollars a year. And this addedto their present income should eliminate poverty. Direct aid to the poor, however, isonly running only about 600 dollars per family. It would seem that someplace there must be someoverhead.Now -- so now we declare war on poverty, orYou, too, can be a Bobby Baker. Now do they honestly expect us to believethat if we add 1 billion dollars to the 45 billion we're spending, one more program to the30-odd we have -- and remember, this new program doesn't replace any, it just duplicatesexisting programs -- do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic?Well, in all fairness I should explain there is one part of the new program thatisn't duplicated. This is the youth feature. We're now going to solve the dropoutproblem, juvenile delinquency, by reinstituting something like the oldCCC camps [Civilian Conservation Corps], and we're going to put our young people in these camps. But again we do some arithmetic, and we findthat we're going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person wehelp 4,700 dollars a year. We can send them to Harvard for 2,700! Course, don't get me wrong. I'm notsuggesting Harvard is the answer to juvenile delinquency.But seriously, what are we doing to those we seek tohelp? Not too long ago, a judge called me here in Los Angeles. He told me of a young womanwho'd come before him for a divorce. She had six children, was pregnant with herseventh. Under his questioning, she revealed her husband was a laborer earning 250 dollars a month. She wanted a divorce to get an 80 dollar raise. She's eligible for 330 dollars amonth in the Aid to Dependent Children Program. She got the idea from two women in herneighborhood who'd already done that very thing.Yet anytime you and I question the schemes of thedo-gooders, we're denounced as being against their humanitarian goals. They say we'realways against things -- we're never for anything. Well, the trouble with our liberal friends is not thatthey're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't so. Now -- we're for a provision that destitution should notfollow unemployment by reason of old age, and to that end we've accepted Social Securityas a step toward meeting the problem.But we're against those entrusted with this programwhen they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that anycriticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on themfor a livelihood. They've called it insurance to us in a hundred million pieces ofliterature. But then they appeared before the Supreme Court and they testified it wasa welfare program. They only use the term insurance to sell it to the people.And they said Social Security dues are a tax for the general use of the government, andthe government has used that tax. There is no fund, because Robert Byers, the actuarialhead, appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that Social Security as ofthis moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole. But he said there should be no cause for worrybecause as long as they have the power to tax, they could always take away from the peoplewhatever they needed to bail them out of trouble. And they're doing just that.A young man, 21 years of age, working at an averagesalary -- his Social Security contribution would, in the open market, buy him an insurancepolicy that would guarantee 220 dollars a month at age 65. The government promises 127. He couldlive it up until he's 31 and then take out a policy that would pay more than SocialSecurity. Now are we so lacking in business sense that we can't put this program on asound basis, so that people who do require those payments will find they can get themwhen they're due -- that the cupboard isn't bare?Barry Goldwater thinks we can.At the same time, can't we introduce voluntary featuresthat would permit a citizen who can do better on his own to be excused upon presentationof evidence that he had made provision for the non-earning years? Should we not allow a widowwith children to work, and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceasedhusband? Shouldn't you and I be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program, which we cannot do? I think we're for telling our senior citizens that noone in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds. But I thinkwe're against forcing all citizens, regardless of need, into a compulsory governmentprogram, especially when we have such examples, as was announced last week, when Franceadmitted that their Medicare program is now bankrupt. They've come to the end of theroad.In addition, was Barry Goldwater so irresponsible whenhe suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate, planned inflation, sothat when you do get your Social Security pension, a dollar will buy a dollar's worth, andnot 45 cents worth?I think we're for an international organization, wherethe nations of the world can seek peace. But I think we're against subordinating Americaninterests to an organization that has become so structurally unsound that today you canmuster a two-thirds vote on the floor of the General Assembly among nations thatrepresent less than 10 percent of the world's population. I think we're against thehypocrisy of assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a colony, while weengage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the millions of peopleenslaved in the Soviet colonies in the satellite nations.I think we're for aiding our allies by sharing of ourmaterial blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs, but we'reagainst doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy, if not socialism,all over the world. We set out to help 19 countries. We're helping 107. We've spent 146billion dollars. With that money, we bought a 2 million dollar yacht for Haile Selassie. We bought dresssuits for Greek undertakers, extra wives for Kenya[n] government officials. We bought athousand TV sets for a place where they have no electricity. In the last six years, 52nations have bought 7 billion dollars worth of our gold, and all 52 are receiving foreign aidfrom this country.No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size.So, governments' programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is thenearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth.Federal employees -- federal employees number two and a halfmillion; and federal, state, and local, one out of six of the nation's work forceemployed by government. These proliferating bureaus with their thousands ofregulations have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards. How many of us realizethat today federal agents can invade a man's property without a warrant? They can impose afine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize and sell hisproperty at auction to enforce the payment of that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, JamesWier over-planted his rice allotment. The government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment. And aU.S. marshal sold his 960-acre farm at auction. The government said it was necessary as awarning to others to make the system work. Last February 19th at the University ofMinnesota, Norman Thomas, six-times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket,said, If Barry Goldwater became President, he would stop the advance of socialism inthe United States. I think that's exactly what he will do.But as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, camebefore the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking theParty of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin,and Stalin. And he walked away from his Party, and he never returned til the day he died --because to this day, the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party, thathonorable Party, down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England.Now it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation ofprivate property or business to impose socialism on a people. What does it mean whetheryou hold the deed to the -- or the title to your business or property if the government holds thepower of life and death over that business or property? And such machinery already exists. Thegovernment can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute.Every businessman has his own tale of harassment. Somewhere a perversion has taken place.Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, andfreedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at thismoment. Our Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues. They want to makeyou and I believe that this is a contest between two men -- that we're to choose justbetween two personalities.Well what of this man that they would destroy -- and indestroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the ideas that you and I holddear? Is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is? Well I've beenprivileged to know him when. I knew him long before he ever dreamed of tryingfor high office, and I can tell you personally I've never known a man in my life Ibelieved so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing.This is a man who, in his own business before heentered politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it.He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees. He took 50 percent of theprofits before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan for all hisemployees. He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and couldn't work. Heprovides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores. When Mexico wasravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande, he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine andsupplies down there.An ex-GI told me how he met him. It was the week beforeChristmas during the Korean War, and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get aride home to Arizona for Christmas. And he said that [there were] a lot of servicemen thereand no seats available on the planes. And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said,Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona, go to runway such-and-such, andthey went down there, and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in hisplane. Every day in those weeks before Christmas, all day long, he'd load up the plane,fly it to Arizona, fly them to their homes, fly back over to get another load.During the hectic split-second timing of a campaign,this is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who was dying of cancer. Hiscampaign managers were understandably impatient, but he said, There aren't many leftwho care what happens to her. I'd like her to know I care. This is a man who said tohis 19-year-old son, There is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness,and when you begin to build your life on that rock, with the cement of the faith in Godthat you have, then you have a real start. This is not a man who could carelesslysend other people's sons to war. And that is the issue of this campaign that makes all the other problems I've discussed academic, unless we realize we're in a war thatmust be won.Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchenof the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace withoutvictory. They call their policy accommodation. And they say if we'll only avoidany direct confrontation with the enemy, he'll forget his evil ways and learn to loveus. All who oppose them are indicted as warmongers. They say we offer simple answers tocomplex problems. Well, perhaps there is a simple answer -- not an easy answer -- but simple: If you and I have the courage to tell our electedofficials that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts ismorally right.We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb bycommitting an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the IronCurtain, Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willingto make a deal with your slave masters. Alexander Hamilton said, A nationwhich can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one.Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war,but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace -- and you can have it in the nextsecond -- surrender.Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we followother than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies inappeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face -- thattheir policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace andwar, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back andretreat, eventually we have to face the final demand -- the ultimatum. And what then -- whenNikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told themthat we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comesto deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we willhave been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this becausefrom our side he's heard voices pleading for peace at any price orbetter Red than dead, or as one commentator put it, he'd rather liveon his knees than die on his feet. And therein lies the road to war, because thosevoices don't speak for the rest of us.You and I know and do not believe that life is so dearand peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing inlife is worth dying for, when did this begin -- just in the face of this enemy? Or shouldMoses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? ShouldChrist have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown downtheir guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of historywere not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazisdidn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer afterall.You and I have the courage to say to our enemies,There is a price we will not pay. There is a point beyond which they must notadvance. And this -- this is the meaning in the phrase of Barry Goldwater's peace throughstrength. Winston Churchill said, The destiny of man is not measured bymaterial computations. When great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we'respirits -- not animals. And he said, There's something going on in time andspace, and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty.You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We'llpreserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we'll sentencethem to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness.We will keep in mind and remember that Barry Goldwaterhas faith in us. He has faith that you and I have the ability and the dignity and theright to make our own decisions and determine our own destiny.Thank you very much.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Long -- Every Man a King Radio Speech  Huey P. LongEvery Man a King -- Radio Speech to the Nation delivered 23 February 1934 for flashIs that a right of life, when the young children of this country are being reared into a sphere which is more owned by 12 men that is by 120 million people?Ladies and gentlemen, I have only 30 minutes in which to speak toyou this evening, and I, therefore, will not be able to discuss in detail so much as I canwrite when I have all of the time and space that is allowed me for the subjects, but Iwill undertake to sketch them very briefly without manuscript or preparation, so that youcan understand them so well as I can tell them to you tonight.I contend, my friends, that we have no difficult problem to solve inAmerica, and that is the view of nearly everyone with whom I have discussed the matterhere in Washington and elsewhere throughout the United States -- that we have no verydifficult problem to solve.It is not the difficulty of the problem which we have; it is thefact that the rich people of this country -- and by rich people I mean the super-rich --will not allow us to solve the problems, or rather the one little problem that isafflicting this country, because in order to cure all of our woes it is necessary to scaledown the big fortunes, that we may scatter the wealth to be shared by all of the people.We have a marvelous love for this Government of ours; in fact, it isalmost a religion, and it is well that it should be, because we have a splendid form ofgovernment and we have a splendid set of laws. We have everything here that we need,except that we have neglected the fundamentals upon which the American Government wasprincipally predicated.How may of you remember the first thing that the Declaration ofIndependence said? It said, We hold these truths to be self-evident, that there arecertain inalienable rights of the people, and among them are life, liberty, and thepursuit of happiness; and it said, further, We hold the view that all men arecreated equal.Now, what did they mean by that? Did they mean, my friends, to saythat all me were created equal and that that meant that any one man was born to inherit$10,000,000,000 and that another child was to be born to inherit nothing?Did that mean, my friends, that someone would come into this worldwithout having had an opportunity, of course, to have hit one lick of work, should be bornwith more than it and all of its children and children's children could ever dispose of,but that another one would have to be born into a life of starvation?That was not the meaning of the Declaration of Independence when itsaid that all men are created equal of That we hold that all men are createdequal.Now was it the meaning of the Declaration of Independence when itsaid that they held that there were certain rights that were inalienable -- the right oflife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Is that right of life, my friends, when theyoung children of this country are being reared into a sphere which is more owned by 12men than it is by 120,000,000 people?Is that, my friends, giving them a fair shake of the dice oranything like the inalienable right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, oranything resembling the fact that all people are created equal; when we have today inAmerica thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of children on the verge ofstarvation in a land that is overflowing with too much to eat and too much to wear? I donot think you will contend that, and I do not think for a moment that they will contendit.Now let us see if we cannot return this Government to theDeclaration of Independence and see if we are going to do anything regarding it. Whyshould we hesitate or why should we quibble or why should we quarrel with one another tofind out what the difficulty is, when we know what the Lord told us what the difficultyis, and Moses wrote it out so a blind man could see it, then Jesus told us all about it,and it was later written in the Book of James, where everyone could read it?I refer to the Scriptures, now, my friends, and give you what itsays not for the purpose of convincing you of the wisdom of myself, not for the purposeladies and gentlemen, of convincing you of the fact that I am quoting the Scripture meansthat I am to be more believed than someone else; but I quote you the Scripture, ratherrefer you to the Scripture, because whatever you see there you may rely upon will never bedisproved so long as you or your children or anyone may live; and you may further dependupon the fact that not one historical fact that the Bible has ever contained has ever yetbeen disproved by any scientific discovery or by reason of anything that has beendisclosed to man through his own individual mind or through the wisdom of the Lord whichthe Lord has allowed him to have.But the Scripture says, ladies and gentlemen, that no country cansurvive, or for a country to survive it is necessary that we keep the wealth scatteredamong the people, that nothing should be held permanently by any one person, and that 50years seems to be the year of jubilee in which all property would be scattered about andreturned to the sources from which it originally came, and every seventh year debt shouldbe remitted.Those two things the Almighty said to be necessary -- I should sayHe knew to be necessary, or else He would not have so prescribed that the property wouldbe kept among the general run of the people and that everyone would continue to share init; so that no one man would get half of it and hand it down to a son, who takes half ofwhat was left, and that son hand it down to another one, who would take half of what wasleft, until, like a snowball going downhill, all of the snow was off of the ground exceptwhat the snowball had.I believe that was the judgment and the view and the law of theLord, that we would have to distribute wealth every so often, in order that there could notbe people starving to death in a land of plenty, as there is in America today. We have inAmerican today more wealth, more goods, more food, more clothing, more houses than we haveever had. We have everything in abundance here. We have the farm problem, my friends,because we have too much cotton, because we have too much wheat, and have too much corn,and too much potatoes.We have a home-loan problem because we have too many houses, and yetnobody can buy them and live in them.We have trouble, my friends, in the country, because we have toomuch money owing, the greatest indebtedness that has ever been given to civilization,where it has been shown that we are incapable of distributing to the actual things thatare here, because the people have not money enough to supply themselves with them, andbecause the greed of a few men is such that they think it is necessary that they owneverything, and their pleasure consists in the starvation of the masses, and in theirpossessing things they cannot use, and their children cannot use, but who bask in thesplendor of sunlight and wealth, casting darkness and despair and impressing it oneveryone else.So, therefore, said the Lord, in effect, if yousee these things that now have occurred and exist in this and other countries, there mustbe a constant scattering of wealth in any country if this country is to survive.Then, said the Lord, in effect, every seventh yearthere shall be a remission of debts; there will be no debts after 7 years. That wasthe law.Now, let us take America today. We have in American today, ladiesand gentlemen, $272,000,000,000 of debt. Two hundred and seventy-two thousand millions ofdollars of debts are owed by the various people of this country today. Why, my friends,that cannot be paid. It is not possible for that kind of debt to be paid.The entire currency of the United States is only $6,000,000,000.That is all of the money that we have got in America today. All the actual money you havegot in all of your banks, all that you have got in the Government Treasury, is$6,000,000,000; and if you took all that money and paid it out today you would still owe$266,000,000,000; and if you took all that money and paid again you would still owe$260,000,000,000; and if you took it, my friends, 20 times and paid it you would still owe$150,000,000,000.You would have to have 45 times the entire money supply of theUnited States today to pay the debts of the people of America, and then they would justhave to start out from scratch, without a dime to go on with.So, my friends, it is impossible to pay all of these debts, and youmight as well find out that it cannot be done. The United States Supreme Court hasdefinitely found out that it could not be done, because, in a Minnesota case, it held thatwhen a State has postponed the evil day of collecting a debt it was a valid andconstitutional exercise of legislative power.Now, ladies and gentlemen, if I may proceed to give you some otherwords that I think you can understand -- I am not going to belabor you by quoting tonight-- I am going to tell you what the wise men of all ages and all times, down even to thepresent day, have all said: That you must keep the wealth of the country scattered, andyou must limit the amount that any one man can own. You cannot let any man own$300,000,000,000 or $400,000,000,000. If you do, one man can own all of the wealth thatthey United States has in it.Now, my friends, if you were off on an island where there were 100lunches, you could not let one man eat up the hundred lunches, or take the hundred lunchesand not let anybody else eat any of them. If you did, there would not be anything else forthe balance of the people to consume.So, we have in America today, my friends, a condition by which about10 men dominate the means of activity in at least 85 percent of the activities that youown. They either own directly everything or they have got some kind of mortgage on it,with a very small percentage to be excepted. They own the banks, they own the steel mills,they own the railroads, they own the bonds, they own the mortgages, they own the stores,and they have chained the country from one end to the other, until there is not any kindof business that a small, independent man could go into today and make a living, and thereis not any kind of business that an independent man can go into and make any money to buyan automobile with; and they have finally and gradually and steadily eliminated everybodyfrom the fields in which there is a living to be made, and still they have got littleenough sense to think they ought to be able to get more business out of it anyway.If you reduce a man to the point where he is starving to death andbleeding and dying, how do you expect that man to get hold of any money to spend with you?It is not possible. Then, ladies and gentlemen, how do you expect people to live, when thewherewith cannot be had by the people?In the beginning I quoted from the Scriptures. I hope you willunderstand that I am not quoting Scripture to convince you of my goodness personally,because that is a thing between me and my Maker, that is something as to how I stand withmy Maker and as to how you stand with your Maker. That is not concerned with this issue,except and unless there are those of you who would be so good as to pray for the souls ofsome of us. But the Lord gave his law, and in the Book of James they said so, that therich should weep and howl for the miseries that had come upon them; and, therefore, it waswritten that when the rich hold goods they could not use and could not consume, you willinflict punishment on them, and nothing but days of woe ahead of them.Then we have heard of the great Greek philosopher, Socrates, and thegreater Greek philosopher, Plato, and we have read the dialog between Plato and Socrates,in which one said that great riches brought on great poverty, and would be destructive ofa country. Read what they said. Read what Plato said; that you must not let any one man betoo poor, and you must not let any one man be too rich; that the same mill that grinds outthe extra rich is the mill that will grind out the extra poor, because, in order that theextra rich can become so affluent, they must necessarily take more of what ordinarilywould belong to the average man.It is a very simple process of mathematics that you do not have tostudy, and that no one is going to discuss with you.So that was the view of Socrates and Plato. That was the view of theEnglish statesmen. That was the view of American statesmen. That was the view of Americanstatesmen like Daniel Webster, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, William Jennings Bryan,and Theodore Roosevelt, and even as late as Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt.Both of these men, Mr. Hoover and Mr. Roosevelt, came out and saidthere had to be a decentralization of wealth, but neither one of them did anything aboutit. But, nevertheless, they recognized the principle. The fact that neither one of themever did anything about it is their own problem that I am not undertaking to criticize;but had Mr. Hoover carried out what he says ought to be done, he would be retiring fromthe President's office, very probably, 3 years from now, instead of 1 year ago; and hadMr. Roosevelt proceeded along the lines that he stated were necessary for thedecentralization of wealth, he would have gone, my friends, a long way already, and withina few months he would have probably reached a solution of all of the problems that afflictthis country.But I wish to warn you now that nothing that has been done up tothis date has taken one dime away from these big-fortune holders; they own just as much asthey did, and probably a little bit more; they hold just as many of the debts of thecommon people as they ever held, and probably a little bit more; and unless we, myfriends, are going to give the people of this country a fair shake of the dice, by whichthey will all get something out of the funds of this land, there is not a chance on thetopside of this God's eternal earth by which we can rescue this country and rescue thepeople of this country.It is necessary to save the Government of the country, but is muchmore necessary to save the people of America. We love this country. We love thisGovernment. It is a religion, I say. It is a kind of religion people have read of whenwomen, in the name of religion, would take their infant babes and throw them into theburning flame, where they would be instantly devoured by the all-consuming fire, in daysgone by; and there probably are some people of the world even today, who, in the name ofreligion, throw their tear-dimmed eyes into the sad faces of their fathers and mothers,who cannot given them food and clothing they both needed, and which is necessary tosustain them, and that goes on day after day, and night after night, when day gets intodarkness and blackness, knowing those children would arise in the morning without beingfed, and probably to bed at night without being fed.Yet in the name of our Government, and all alone, those peopleundertake and strive as hard as they can to keep a good government alive, and how longthey can stand that no one knows. If I were in their place tonight, the place wheremillions are, I hope that I would have what I might say -- I cannot give you the word toexpress the kind of fortitude they have; that is the word -- I hope that I might have thefortitude to praise and honor my Government that had allowed me here in this land, wherethere is too much to eat and too much to wear, to starve in order that a handful of mencan have so much more than they can ever eat or they can ever wear.Now, we have organized a society, and we call it Share OurWealth Society, a society with the motto every man a king.Every man a king, so there would be no such thing as a man or womanwho did not have the necessities of life, who would not be dependent upon the whims andcaprices and ipsi dixit of the financial martyrs for a living. What do we propose by thissociety? We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of$15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.We do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose adivision of wealth, but we propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflictedupon any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality, or$15,000 to families. No; but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for anyone family to hold, that there should be a guaranty of a family wealth of around $5,000;enough for a home, and automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and theopportunity to educate their children; a fair share of the income of this land thereafterto that family so there will be no such thing as merely the select to have those things,and so there will be no such thing as a family living in poverty and distress.We have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow noone man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able tocarry out the balance of the program. It may be necessary that we limit it to less than$50,000,000. It may be necessary, in working out of the plans, that no man's fortune wouldbe more than $10,000,000 or $15,000,000. But be that as it may, it will still be more thanany one man, or any one man and his children and their children, will be able to spend intheir lifetimes; and it is not necessary or reasonable to have wealth piled up beyond thatpoint where we cannot prevent poverty among the masses.Another thing we propose is old-age pension of $30 a month foreveryone that is 60 years old. Now, we do not give this pension to a man making $1,000 ayear, and we do not give it to him if he has $10,000 in property, but outside of that wedo.We will limit hours of work. There is not any necessity of havingover-production. I think all you have got to do, ladies and gentlemen, is just limit thehours of work to such an extent as people will work only so long as is necessary toproduce enough for all of the people to have what they need. Why, ladies and gentleman,let us say that all of these labor-saving devices reduce hours down to where you do nothave to work but 4 hours a day; that is enough for these people, and then praise be thename of the Lord, if it gets that good. Let it be good and not a curse, and then we willhave 5 hours a day and 5 days a week, or even less that that, and we might give a man awhole month off during a year, or give him 2 months; and we might do what other countrieshave seen fit to do, and what I did in Louisiana, by having schools by which adults couldgo back and learn the things that have been discovered since they went to school.We will not have any trouble taking care of the agriculturalsituation. All you have to do is balance your production with your consumption. You simplyhave to abandon a particular crop that you have too much of, and all you have to do isstore the surplus for the next year, and the Government will take it over. When you havegood crops in the area in which the crops that have been planted are sufficient foranother year, put in your public works in the particular year when you do not need toraise any more, and by that means you get everybody employed. When the Government hasenough of any particular crop to take care of all of the people, that will be all that isnecessary; and in order to do all of this, our taxation is going to be to take thebillion-dollar fortunes and strip them down to frying size, not to exceed $50,000,000, andit is necessary to come to $10,000,000, we will come to $10,000,000. We have worked theproposition out to guarantee a limit upon property (and no man will own less than one thirdthe average), and guarantee a reduction of fortunes and a reduction of hours to spreadwealth throughout this country. We would care for the old people above 60 and take themaway from this thriving industry and given them a chance to enjoy the necessities and livein ease, and thereby lift from the market the labor which would probably create a surplusof commodities.Those are the things we propose to do. Every man a king.Every man to eat when there is something to eat; all to wear something when there issomething to wear. That makes us all sovereign.You cannot solve these things through these various and sundryalphabetical codes. You can have the N.R.A. and P.W.A. and C.W.A. and the U.U.G. andG.I.N. and any other kind of dad-gummed lettered code. You can wait untildoomsday and see 25 more alphabets, but that is not going to solve this proposition. Whyhide? Why quibble? You know what the trouble is. The man that says he does not know whatthe trouble is just hiding his face to keep from seeing the sunlight.God told you what the trouble was. The philosophers told you whatthe trouble was; and when you have a country where one man owns more than 100,000 people,or a million people, and when you have a country where there are four men, as in America,that have got more control over things than all the 120,000,000 people together, you knowwhat the trouble is.We had these great incomes in this country; but the farmer, whoplowed from sunup to sundown, who labored here from sunup to sundown for 6 days a week,wound up at the end of the with practically nothing.And we ought to take care of the veterans of the wars in thisprogram. That is a small matter. Suppose it does cost a billion dollars a year -- thatmeans that the money will be scattered throughout this country. We ought to pay them abonus. We can do it. We ought to take care of every single one of the sick and disabledveterans. I do not care whether a man got sick on the battlefield or did not; every manthat wore the uniform of this country is entitled to be taken care of, and there is moneyenough to do it; and we need to spread the wealth of the country, which you did not do inwhat you call the N.R.A.If the N.R.A. has done any good, I can put it all in my eyewithout having it hurt. All I can see that N.R.A. has done is to put the little man outof business -- the little merchant in his store, the little Dago that is running a fruitstand, or the Greek shoe-shining stand, who has to take hold of a code of 275 pages andstudy with a spirit level and compass and looking-glass; he has to hire a Philadelphialawyer to tell him what is in the code; and by the time he learns what the code is, he isin jail or out of business; and they have got a chain code system that has already put himout of business. The N.R.A. is not worth anything, and I said so when they put it through.Now, my friends, we have got to hit the root with the axe.Centralized power in the hands of a few, with centralized credit in the hands of a few, isthe trouble.Get together in your community tonight or tomorrow and organize oneof our Share Our Wealth societies. If you do not understand it, write me and let me sendyou the platform; let me give you the proof of it.This is Huey P. Long talking, United States Senator, Washington,D.C. Write me and let me send you the data on this proposition. Enroll with us. Let usmake known to the people what we are going to do. I will send you a button, if I have gotenough of them left. We have got a little button that some of our friends designed, withour message around the rim of the button, and in the center Every man a king.Many thousands of them are meeting through the United States, and every day we are gettinghundreds and hundreds of letters. Share Our Wealth societies are now being organized, andpeople have it within their power to relieve themselves from this terrible situation.Look at what the Mayo brothers announced this week, these greatestscientists of all the world today, who are entitled to have more money than all theMorgans and the Rockefellers, or anyone else, and yet the Mayos turn back their bigfortunes to be used for treating the sick, and said they did not want to lay up fortunesin this earth, but wanted to turn them back where they would do some good; but the otherbig capitalists are not willing to do that, are not willing to do what these men, 10 timesmore worthy, have already done, and it is going to take a law to require them to do it.Organize your Share Our Wealth Society and get your people to meetwith you, and make known your wishes to your Senators and Representatives in Congress.Now, my friends, I am going to stop. I thank you for thisopportunity to talk to you. I am having to talk under the auspices and by the grace andpermission of the National Broadcasting System tonight, and they are letting me talk free.If I had the money, and I wish I had the money, I would like to talk to you more often onthis line, but I have not got it, and I cannot expect these people to give it to me freeexcept on some rare instance. But, my friends, I hope to have the opportunity to talk withyou, and I am writing to you, and I hope that you will get up and help in the work,because the resolution and bills are before Congress, and we hope to have your help ingetting together and organizing your Share Our Wealth society.Now, that I have but a minute left, I want to say that I suppose myfamily is listening in on the radio in New Orleans, and I will say to my wife and threechildren that I am entirely well and hope to be home before many more days, and I hopethey have listened to my speech tonight, and I wish them and all their neighbors andfriends everything good that may be had.I thank you, my friends, for your kind attention, and I hope youwill enroll with us, take care of your own work in the work of this Government, and shareor help in our Share Our Wealth society.I thank you.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,26," Anna Howard Shaw - The Fundamental Principle of a RepublicAnna Howard ShawThe Fundamental Principle of a Republic delivered 21 June 1915, Ogdenburg, New York for flashWhen I came into your hall tonight, I thought of the last time I was in your city. Twenty-one years ago I came here with Susan B. Anthony, and we came for exactly the same purpose as that for which we are here tonight. Boys have been born since that time and have become voters, and the women are still trying to persuade American men to believe in the fundamental principles of democracy, and I never quite feel as if it was a fair field to argue this question with men, because in doing it you have to assume that a man who professes to believe in a Republican form of government does not believe in a Republican form of government, for the only thing that woman's enfranchisement means at all is that a government which claims to be a Republic should be a Republic, and not an aristocracy.The difficulty with discussing this question with those who oppose us is that they make any number of arguments but none of them have anything to do with Woman's Suffrage; they always have something to do with something else, therefore the arguments which we have to make rarely ever have anything to do with the subject, because we have to answer our opponents who always escape the subject as far as possible in order to have any sort of reason in connection with what they say.Now one of two things is true: either a Republic is a desirable form of government, or else it is not. If it is, then we should have it, if it is not then we ought not to pretend that we have it. We ought at least be true to our ideals, and the men of New York have for the first time in their lives, the rare opportunity on the second day of next November, of making the state truly a part of the Republic. It is the greatest opportunity which has ever come to the men of the state. They have never had so serious a problem to solve before, they will never have a more serious problem to solve in any future of our nation's life, and the thing that disturbs me more than anything else in connection with it is that so few people realize what a profound problem they have to solve on November 2. It is not merely a trifling matter; it is not a little thing that does not concern the state, it is the most vital problem we could have, and any man who goes to the polls on the second day of next November without thoroughly informing himself in regard to this subject is unworthy to be a citizen of this state, and unfit to cast a ballot.If woman's suffrage is wrong, it is a great wrong; if it is right, it is a profound and fundamental principle, and we all know, if we know what a Republic is, that it is the fundamental principle upon which a Republic must rise. Let us see where we are as a people; how we act here and what we think we are. The difficulty with the men of this country is that they are so consistent in their inconsistency that they are not aware of having been inconsistent; because their consistency has been so continuous and their inconsistency so consecutive that it has never been broken, from the beginning of our Nation's life to the present time.If we trace our history back we will find that from the very dawn of our existence as a people, men have been imbued with a spirit and a vision more lofty than they have been able to live; they have been led by visions of the sublimest truth, both in regard to religion and in regard to government that ever inspired the souls of men from the time the Puritans left the old world to come to this country, led by the Divine ideal which is the sublimest and the supremest ideal in religious freedom which men have ever known, the theory that a man has a right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, without the intervention of any other man or any other group of men. And it was this theory, this vision of the right of the human soul which led men first to the shores of this country.Now, nobody can deny that they are sincere, honest, and earnest men. No one can deny that the Puritans were men of profound conviction, and yet these men who gave up everything in behalf of an ideal, hardly established their communities in this new country before they began to practice exactly the same sort of persecutions on other men which had been practiced upon them. They settled in their communities on the New England shores and when they formed their compacts by which they governed their local societies, they permitted no man to have a voice in the affairs unless he was a member of the church, and not a member of any church, but a member of the particular church which dominated the particular community in which he happened to be.In Massachusetts they drove the Baptists down to Rhode Island; in Connecticut they drove the Presbyterians over to New Jersey; they burned the Quakers in Massachusetts and ducked the witches, and no colony, either Catholic or Protestant allowed a Jew to have a voice. And so a man must worship God according to the conscience of the particular community in which he was located, and yet they called that religious freedom, they were not able to live the ideal of religious liberty, and from that time to this the men of this government have been following along the same line of inconsistency, while they too have been following a vision of equal grandeur and power.Never in the history of the world did it dawn upon the human mind as it dawned upon your ancestors, what it would mean for men to be free. They got the vision of a government in which the people would be the supreme power, and so inspired by this vision men wrote such documents as were went from the Massachusetts legislature, from the New York legislature and from the Pennsylvania group over to the Parliament of Great Britain, which rang with the profoundest measures of freedom and justice. They did not equivocate in a single word when they wrote the Declaration of Independence; no one can dream that these men had not got the sublimest ideal of democracy which had ever dawned upon the souls of men. But as soon as the war was over and our government was formed, instead of asking the question, who shall be the governing force in this great new Republic, when they brought those thirteen little territories together, they began to eliminate instead of include the men who should be the great governing forces, and they said, who shall have the voice in this great new Republic, and you would have supposed that such men as fought the Revolutionary War would have been able to answer that every man who has fought, everyone who has given up all he has and all he has been able to accumulate shall be free, it never entered their minds.These excellent ancestors of yours had not been away from the old world long enough to realize that man is of more value than his purse, so they said every man who has an estate in the government shall have a voice; and they said what shall that estate be? And they answered that a man who had property valued at two hundred and fifty dollars will be able to cast a vote, and so they sang The land of the free and the home of the brave. And they wrote into their Constitution, All males who pay taxes on $250 shall cast a vote, and they called themselves a Republic, and we call ourselves a Republic, and they were not quite so much of a Republic that we should be called a Republic yet. We might call ourselves angels, but that wouldn't make us angels, you have got to be an angel before you are an angel, and you have got to be a Republic before you are a Republic. Now what did we do? Before the word male in the local compacts, they wrote the word Church-members; and they wrote in the word taxpayer.Then there arose a great Democrat, Thomas Jefferson, who looked down into the day when you and I are living and saw that the rapidly accumulated wealth in the hands of a few men would endanger the liberties of the people, and he knew what you and I know, that no power under heaven or among men is known in a Republic by which men can defend their liberties except by the power of the ballot, and so the Democratic party took another step in the evolution of the Republic out of a monarchy and they rubbed out the word taxpayer and wrote in the word white, and then the Democrats thought the millennium had come, and they sang  The land of the free and the home of the brave as lustily as the Republicans had sung it before them and spoke of the divine right of motherhood with the same thrill in their voices and at the same time they were selling mother's babies by the pound on the auction block-and mothers apart from their babies.Another arose who said a man is not a good citizen because he is white, he is a good citizen because he is a man, and the Republican party took out that progressive evolutionary eraser and rubbed out the word white from before the word male' and could not think of another word to put in there- they were all in, black and white, rich and poor, wise and otherwise, drunk and sober; not a man left out to be put in, and so the Republicans could not write anything before the word male, and they had to let the little word, male stay alone by itself.And God said in the beginning, It is not good for man to stand alone. That is why we are here tonight, and that is all that woman's suffrage means; just to repeat again and again that first declaration of the Divine, It is not good for man to stand alone, and so the women of this state are asking that the word male shall be stricken out of the Constitution altogether and that the Constitution stand as it ought to have stood in the beginning and as it must before this state is any part of a Republic. Every citizen possessing the necessary qualifications shall be entitled to cast one vote at every election, and have that vote counted. We are not asking as our Anti-Suffrage friends think we are, for any of awful things that we hear will happen if we are allowed to vote; we are simply asking that that government which professes to be a Republic shall be a Republic and not pretend to be what it is not.Now what is a Republic? Take your dictionary, encyclopedia lexicon or anything else you like and look up the definition and you will find that a Republic is a form of government in which the laws are enacted by representatives elected by the people. Now when did the people of New York ever elect their own representatives? Never in the world. The men of New York have, and I grant you that men are people, admirable people, as far as they go, but they only go half way. There is still another half of the people who have not elected representatives, and you never read a definition of a Republic in which half of the people elect representatives to govern the whole of the people. That is an aristocracy and that is just what we are. We have been many kinds of aristocracies. We have been a hierarchy of church members, than an oligarchy of sex.There are two old theories, which are dying today. Dying hard, but dying. One of them is dying on the plains of Flanders and the Mountains of Galicia and Austria, and that is the theory of the divine right of kings. The other is dying here in the state of New York and Massachusetts and New Jersey and Pennsylvania and that is the divine right of sex. Neither of them had a foundation in reason, or justice, or common sense.Now I want to make this proposition, and I believe every man will accept it. Of course he will if he is intelligent. Whenever a Republic prescribes the qualifications as applying equally to all the citizens of the Republic, when the Republic says in order to vote, a citizen must be twenty-one years of age, it applies to all alike, there is no discrimination against any race or sex. When the government says that a citizen must be a native-born citizen or a naturalized citizen that applies to all; we are either born or naturalized, somehow or other we are here. Whenever the government says that a citizen, in order to vote, must be a resident of a community a certain length of time, and of the state a certain length of time and of the nation a certain length of time, that applies to all equally. There is no discrimination.We might go further and we might say that in order to vote the citizen must be able to read his ballot. We have not gone that far yet. We have been very careful of male ignorance in these United States.I was much interested, as perhaps many of you, in reading the Congressional Record this last winter over the debate over the immigration bill, and when that illiteracy clause was introduced into the immigration bill, what fear there was in the souls of men for fear we would do injustice to some of the people who might want to come to our shores, and I was much and I was much interested in the language in which the President vetoed the bill, when he declared that by inserting the clause we would keep out of our shores a large body of very excellent people. I could not help wondering then how it happens that male ignorance is so much less ignorant than female ignorance. When I hear people say that if women were permitted to vote a large body of ignorant people would vote, and therefore because an ignorant woman would vote, no intelligent women should be allowed to vote, I wonder why we have made it so easy for male ignorance and so hard for female ignorance.When I was a girl, years ago, I lived in the back woods and there the number of votes cast at each election depended entirely upon the size of the ballot box. We had what was known as the old- tissue ballots and the man who got the most tissue in was the man elected. Now the best part of our community was very much disturbed by this method, and they did not know what to do in order to get a ballot both safe and secret; but they heard that over in Australia, where the women voted, they had a ballot which was both safe and secret, so we went over there and we got the Australian ballot and we brought it here. But when we got it over we found it was not adapted to this country, because in Australia they have to be able to read their ballot. Now the question was how could we adapt it to our conditions? Someone discovered that if you should put a symbol at the head of each column, like a rooster, or an eagle, or a hand holding a hammer, that if a man has intelligence to know the difference between a rooster and an eagle he will know which political party to vote for, and when the ballot was adapted it was a very beautiful ballot, it looked like a page from Life.Now almost any American could vote that ballot, or if she had not that intelligence to know the difference between an eagle and a rooster, we could take the eagle out and put in the hen. Now when we take so much pains to adapt the ballot to the male intelligence of the United States, we should be very humble when we talk about female ignorance. Now if we should take a vote and the men had to read their ballot in order to vote it, more women could vote than men. But when the government says not only that you must be twenty-one years of age, a resident of the community and native born or naturalized, those are qualifications, but when it says that an elector must be a male, that is not a qualification for citizenship; that is an insurmountable barrier between one half of the people and the other half of the citizens and their rights as citizens. No such nation can call itself a Republic. It is only an aristocracy. That barrier must be removed before the government can become a Republic, and that is exactly what we are asking right now, that the last step in the evolutionary process be taken on November 2d. and that this great state of New York shall become in fact as it is in theory, a part of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.Men know the inconsistencies themselves; they realize it in one way while they do not realize it in another, because you never heard a man make a political speech when he did not speak of this country as a whole as though the thing existed which does not exist and that is that the people were equally free, because you hear them declare over and over again on the Fourth of July under God the people rule. They know it is not true, but they say it with a great hurrah, and they repeat over and over again that clause from the Declaration of Independence. Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and they see how they can prevent half of us from giving our consent to anything, and then they give it to us on the Fourth of July in two languages, so if it is not true in one it will be in the other, vox populi, vox Dei. The voice of the people is the voice of God, and the orator forgets that in the people's voice there is a soprano as well as a bass.If the voice of the people is the voice of God, how are we ever going to know what God's voice is when we are content to listen to a bass solo? Now if it is true that the voice of the people is the voice of God, we will never know what the Deity's voice in government is until the bass and soprano are mingled together, the result of which will be the divine harmony. Take any of the magnificent appeals for freedom, which men make, and rob them of their universal application and you take the very life and soul out of them.Where is the difficulty? Just in one thing and one thing only, that men are so sentimental. We used to believe that women were the sentimental sex, but they can not hold a tallow candle compared with the arc light of the men. Men are so sentimental in their attitude about women that they cannot reason about them. Now men are usually very fair to each other. I think the average man recognizes that he has no more right to anything at the hands of the government than has every other man. He has no right at all to anything to which every other man has not an equal right with himself. He says why have I a right to certain things in the government; why have I a right to life and liberty; why have I a right to this or this? Does he say because I am a man? Not at all, because I am human, and being human I have a right to everything which belongs to humanity, and every right which any other human being has, I have. And then he says of his neighbor, and my neighbor he also is human, therefore every right which belongs to me as a human being, belongs to him as a human being, and I have no right to anything under the government to which he is not equally entitled.And then up comes a woman, and then they say now she's a woman; she is not quite human, but she is my wife, or my sister, or my daughter, or an aunt, or my cousin. She is not quite human; she is only related to a human, and being related to a human a human will take care of her. So we have had that care-taking human being to look after us and they have not recognized that women too are equally human with men. Now if men could forget for a minute and believe the anti-suffragists say that we want men to forget that we are related to them, they don't know men, if for a minute they could forget our relationship and remember that we are equally human with themselves, then they would say, yes, and this human being, not because she is a woman, but because she is human is entitled to every privilege and every right under the government which I, as a human being am entitled to.The only reason men do not see as fairly in regard to women as they do in regard to each other is because they have looked upon us from an altogether different plane than what they have looked at men; that is because women have been the homemakers while men have been the so- called protectors, in the period of the world's civilization when people needed to be protected. I know that they say that men protect us now and when we ask them what they are protecting us from the only answer they can give is from themselves. I do not think that men need any very great credit for protecting us from themselves. They are not protecting us from any special thing from which we could not protect ourselves except themselves. Now this old time idea of protection was all right when the world needed this protection, but today the protection in civilization comes from within and not from without.What are the arguments, which our good Anti-friends give us? We know that lately they have stopped to argue and call suffragists all sorts of creatures. If there is anything we believe that we do not believe, we have not heard about them, so the cry goes out of this; the cry of the infant's mind; the cry of a little child. The anti-suffragists' cries are all the cries of little children who are afraid of the unborn and are forever crying, The goblins will catch you if you don't watch out. So that anything that has not been should not be and all that is right, when as a matter of fact if the world believed that we would be in a static condition and never move, except back like a crab. And so the cry goes on.When suffragists are feminists, and when I ask what that is no one is able to tell me. I would give anything to know what a feminist is. They say, would you like to be a feminist? If I could find out I would, you either have to be masculine or feminine and I prefer feminine. Then they cry that we are socialists, and anarchists. Just how a human can be both at the same time, I really do not know. If I know what socialism means it means absolute government and anarchism means no government at all. So we are feminists, socialists, anarchists, and Mormons or spinsters. Now that is about the list. I have not heard the last speech. Now as a matter of fact, as a unit we are nothing, as individuals we are like all other individuals.We have our theories, our beliefs, but as suffragists we have but one belief, but one principle, but one theory and that is the right of a human being to have a voice in the government, under which he or she lives, on that we agree, if on nothing else. Whether we agree or not on religion or politics we are concerned. A clergyman asked me the other day,  By the way, what church does your official board belong to? I said I don't know. He said,  Don't you know what religion your official board believes? I said, Really it never occurred to me, but I will [missing text] them up and see, they are not elected to my board because they believe in any particular church. We had no concern either as to what we believe as religionists or as to what we believe as women in regard to theories of government, except that one fundamental theory in the right of democracy. We do not believe in this fad or the other, but whenever any question is to be settled in any community, then the people of that community shall settle that question, the women people equally with the men people. That is all there is to it, and yet when it comes to arguing our case they bring up all sorts of arguments, and the beauty of it is they always answer all their own arguments. They never make an argument, but they answer it. When I was asked to answer one of their debates I said,  What is the use? Divide up their literature and let them destroy themselves.I was followed up last year by a young, married woman from New Jersey. She left her husband home for three months to tell the women that their place was at home, and that they could not leave home long enough to go to the ballot box, and she brought all her arguments out in pairs and backed them up by statistics. The anti-suffragists can gather more statistics than any other person I ever saw, and there is nothing so sweet and calm as when they say, You cannot deny this, because here are the figures, and figures never lie. Well they don't but some liars figure.When they start out they always begin the same. She started by proving that it was no use to give the women the ballot because if they did have it they would not use it, and she had statistics to prove it. If we would not use it then I really can not see the harm of giving it to us, we would not hurt anybody with it and what an easy way for you men to get rid of us. No more suffrage meetings, never any nagging you again, no one could blame you for anything that went wrong with the town, if it did not run right, all you would have to say is, you have the power, why don't you go ahead and clean up.Then the young lady, unfortunately for her first argument, proved by statistics, of which she had many, the awful results which happened where women did have the ballot; what awful laws have been brought about by women's vote; the conditions that prevail in the homes and how deeply women get interested in politics, because women are hysterical, and we can not think of anything else, we just forget our families, cease to care for our children, cease to love our husbands and just go to the polls and vote and keep on voting for ten hours a day 365 days in the year, never let up, if we ever get to the polls once you will never get us home, so that the women will not vote at all, and they will not do anything but vote. Now these are two very strong anti-suffrage arguments and they can prove them by figures. Then they will tell you that if women are permitted to vote it will be a great expense and no use because wives will vote just as their husbands do; even if we have no husbands, that would not effect the result because we would vote just as our husbands would vote if we had one. How I wish the anti-suffragists could make the men believe that; if they could make men believe that the women would vote just as they wanted them to do you think we would ever have to make another speech or hold another meeting, we would have to vote whether we wanted to or not.And then the very one who will tell you that women will vote just as their husbands do will tell you in five minutes that they will not vote as their husbands will and then the discord in the homes, and the divorce. Why, they have discovered that in Colorado there are more divorces than there were before women began to vote, but they have forgotten to tell you that there are four times as many people in Colorado today as there were when women began to vote, and that may have some effect, particularly as these people went from the East. Then they will tell you all the trouble that happens in the home.A gentleman told me that in California [missing text] and when he was talking I had a wonderful thing pass through my mind, because he said that he and his wife had lived together for twenty years and never had a difference in opinion in the whole twenty years and he was afraid if women began to vote that his wife would vote differently from him and then that beautiful harmony which they had had for twenty years would be broken, and all the time he was talking I could not help wondering which was the idiot because I knew that no intelligent human beings could live together for twenty years and not have a differences of opinion.All the time he was talking I looked at that splendid type of manhood and thought, how would a man feel being tagged up by a little woman for twenty years saying, Me too, me too. I would not want to live in a house with a human being for twenty years who agreed with everything I said. The stagnation of a frog pond would be hilarious compared to that. What a reflection is that on men. If we should say that about men we would never hear the last of it. Now it may be that the kind of men being that the anti-suffragists live with is that kind, but they are not the kind we live with and we could not do it. Great big overgrown babies! Cannot be disputed without having a row! While we do not believe that men are saints, by any means, we do believe that the average American man is a fairly good sort of fellow.In fact my theory of the whole matter is exactly opposite, because instead of believing that men and women will quarrel, I think just the opposite thing will happen. I think just about six weeks before election a sort of honeymoon will start and it will continue until they will think they are again hanging over the gate, all in order to get each other's votes. When men want each other's votes they do not go up and knock them down; they are very solicitous of each other, if they are thirsty or need a smoke or [missing text] well we don't worry about home. The husband and wife who are quarreling after the vote are quarreling now.Then the other belief that the women would not vote if they had a vote and would not do anything else; and would vote just as their husbands vote, and would not vote like their husbands; that women have so many burdens that they cannot bear another burden, and that women are the leisure class.I remember having Reverend Dr. Abbott speak before the anti-suffrage meeting in Brooklyn and he stated that if women were permitted to vote we would not have so much time for charity and philanthropy, and I would like to say, Thank God, there will not be so much need of charity and philanthropy. The end and aim of the suffrage is not to furnish an opportunity for excellent old ladies to be charitable. There are two words that we ought to be able to get along without, and they are charity and philanthropy. They are not needed in a Republic. If we put in the word opportunity instead, that is what Republics stand for.Our doctrine is not to extend the length of our bread lines or the size of our soup kitchens, what we need is for men to have the opportunity to buy their own bread and eat their own soup. We women have used up our lives and strength in fool charities, and we have made more paupers than we have ever helped by the folly of our charities and philanthropies; the unorganized methods by which we deal with the conditions of society, and instead of giving people charity we must learn to give them an opportunity to develop and make themselves capable of earning the bread; no human being has the right to live without toil; toil of some kind, and that old theory that we used to hear The world owes a man a living never was true and never will be true. This world does not owe anybody a living, what it does owe to every human being is the opportunity to earn a living. We have a right to the opportunity and then the right to the living thereafter. We want it. No woman, any more than a man, has the right to live an idle life in this world, we must learn to give back something for the space occupied and we must do our duty wherever duty calls, and the woman herself must decide where her duty calls, just as a man does.Now they tell us we should not vote because we have not the time, we are so burdened that we should not have any more burdens. Then, if that is so, I think we ought to allow the women to vote instead of the men, since we pay a man anywhere from a third to a half more than we do women it would be better to use up the cheap time of the women instead of the dear time of the men. And talking about time you would think it took about a week to vote.A dear, good friend of mine in Omaha said, Now Miss. Shaw, and she held up her child in her arms, is not this my job. I said it certainly is, and then she said, How can I go to the polls and vote and neglect my baby? I said, Has your husband a job? and she said, Why you know he has. I did know it; he was a banker and a very busy one. I said, Yet your husband said he was going to leave husband and go down to the polls and vote, and she said, Oh yes, he is so very interested in election. Then I said, What an advantage you have over your husband, he has to leave his job and you can take your job with you and you do not need to neglect your job. Is it not strange that the only time a woman might neglect her baby is on election day, and then the dear old Antis hold up their hands and say, You have neglected your baby. A woman can belong to a whist club and go once a week and play whist, she cannot take her baby to the whist club, and she has to keep whist herself without trying to keep a baby whist. She can go to the theatre, to church or a picnic and no one is worrying about the baby, but to vote and everyone cries out about the neglect.You would think on Election Day that a woman grabbed up her baby and started out and just dropped it somewhere and paid no attention to it. It used to be asked when we had the question [missing text] box, Who will take care of the babies? I did not know what person could be got to take care of all the babies, so I thought I would go ",,,27,"Franklin Delano Roosevelt - ""The Arsenal of Democracy""  Franklin Delano RooseveltThe Great Arsenal of Democracy   delivered 29December 1940  );  "", ""fdrarsenalofdemocracy7."");   ; for flash[  fromaudio.]  My friends: This is not a fireside chat on war. It is a talk on national security;becausethe nub of the whole purpose of your President is to keep you now, andyour childrenlater, and your grandchildren much later, out of a last-ditch war for thepreservation ofAmerican independence, and all of the things that American independencemeans toyou and to me and to ours.Tonight, in the presence of a world crisis, my mind goes back eight yearsto a night inthe midst of a domestic crisis. It was a time when the wheels of Americanindustrywere grinding to a full stop, when the whole banking system of our countryhad ceasedto function.I well remember that while I sat in my study in the White House, preparingto talk withthe people of the United States, I had before my eyes the picture of allthoseAmericans with whom I was talking. I saw the workmen in the mills, themines, thefactories, the girl behind the counter, the small shopkeeper, the farmerdoing hisspring plowing, the widows and the old men wondering about their life'ssavings. I tried to convey to the great mass of American people what the banking crisismeant tothem in their daily lives.Tonight, I want to do the same thing, with the same people, in this newcrisis whichfaces America.We met the issue of 1933 with courage and realism. We face this new crisis, this newthreat to the security of our nation, with the same courage and realism.Never beforesince Jamestown and Plymouth Rock has our American civilization been insuchdanger as now.For on September 27th, 1940 -- this year -- by an agreement signed in Berlin,threepowerful nations, two in Europe and one in Asia, joined themselves togetherin thethreat that if the United States of America interfered with or blockedthe expansion program of these three nations -- a program aimed at world control   -- theywould unite inultimate action against the United States.The Nazi masters of Germany have made it clear that they intend not onlyto dominateall life and thought in their own country, but also to enslave the wholeof Europe, andthen to use the resources of Europe to dominate the rest of the world.It was only threeweeks ago that their leader stated this: ""There are two worlds that standopposed toeach other."" And then in defiant reply to his opponents he said this: ""Othersare correct when they say: 'With this world we cannot ever reconcile   ourselves.'''I canbeat any other power in the world."" So said the leader of the Nazis.  In other words, the Axis not merely admits but the Axis proclaims thatthere can be noultimate peace between their philosophy -- their philosophy of government  -- and ourphilosophy of government.In view of the nature of this undeniable threat, it can be asserted, properlyandcategorically, that the United States has no right or reason to encouragetalk of peaceuntil the day shall come when there is a clear intention on the part ofthe aggressornations to abandon all thought of dominating or conquering the world.  At this moment the forces of the States that are leagued against all peopleswho live infreedom are being held away from our shores. The Germans and the Italiansarebeing blocked on the other side of the Atlantic by the British and by theGreeks, and bythousands of soldiers and sailors who were able to escape from subjugatedcountries.In Asia the Japanese are being engaged by the Chinese nation in anothergreatdefense.In the Pacific Ocean is our fleet.Some of our people like to believe that wars in Europe and in Asia areof no concernto us. But it is a matter of most vital concern to us that European andAsiaticwar-makers should not gain control of the oceans which lead to this hemisphere.   One hundred and seventeen years ago the Monroe Doctrine was conceived byourgovernment as a measure of defense in the face of a threat against thishemisphereby an alliance in Continental Europe. Thereafter, we stood guard in theAtlantic, withthe British as neighbors. There was no treaty. There was no ""unwrittenagreement."" And yet there was the feeling, proven correct by history, that we as neighborscouldsettle any disputes in peaceful fashion. And the fact is that during thewhole of this timethe Western Hemisphere has remained free from aggression from Europe orfromAsia.Does anyone seriously believe that we need to fear attack anywhere in theAmericaswhile a free Britain remains our most powerful naval neighbor in the Atlantic?Anddoes anyone seriously believe, on the other hand, that we could rest easyif the Axispowers were our neighbors there?If Great Britain goes down, the Axis powers will control the Continentsof Europe, Asia,Africa, Austral-Asia, and the high seas. And they will be in a positionto bring enormousmilitary and naval resources against this hemisphere. It is no exaggerationto say thatall of us in all the Americas would be living at the point of a gun -- agun loaded withexplosive bullets, economic as well as military.We should enter upon a new and terrible era in which the whole world, ourhemisphereincluded, would be run by threats of brute force. And to survive in sucha world, wewould have to convert ourselves permanently into a militaristic power onthe basis ofwar economy.Some of us like to believe that even if Britain falls, we are still safe,because of thebroad expanse of the Atlantic and of the Pacific.But the width of those oceans is not what it was in the days of clipperships. At onepoint between Africa and Brazil the distance is less than it is from WashingtontoDenver, Colorado, five hours for the latest type of bomber. And at thenorth end of thePacific Ocean, America and Asia almost touch each other. Why, even todaywe haveplanes that could fly from the British Isles to New England and back againwithoutrefueling. And remember that the range of the modern bomber is ever beingincreased.During the past week many people in all parts of the nation have told mewhat theywanted me to say tonight. Almost all of them expressed a courageous desireto hearthe plain truth about the gravity of the situation. One telegram, however,expressed theattitude of the small minority who want to see no evil and hear no evil,even though theyknow in their hearts that evil exists. That telegram begged me not to tellagain of theease with which our American cities could be bombed by any hostile powerwhich hadgained bases in this Western Hemisphere. The gist of that telegram was:""Please, Mr.President, don't frighten us by telling us the facts."" Frankly and definitelythere isdanger ahead -- danger against which we must prepare. But we well know thatwecannot escape danger, or the fear of danger, by crawling into bed and pullingthecovers over our heads.Some nations of Europe were bound by solemn nonintervention pacts withGermany. Other nations were assured by Germany that they need never fear invasion.Nonintervention pact or not, the fact remains that they were attacked,overrun, throwninto modern slavery at an hour's notice -- or even without any notice at all.As an exiled leader of one of these nations said to me the other day, ""Thenotice was aminus quantity. It was given to my government two hours after German troopshadpoured into my country in a hundred places."" The fate of these nationstells us what itmeans to live at the point of a Nazi gun.The Nazis have justified such actions by various pious frauds. One of thesefrauds isthe claim that they are occupying a nation for the purpose of ""restoringorder."" Anotheris that they are occupying or controlling a nation on the excuse that theyare ""protectingit"" against the aggression of somebody else.For example, Germany has said that she was occupying Belgium to save theBelgiansfrom the British. Would she then hesitate to say to any South Americancountry: ""Weare occupying you to protect you from aggression by the United States""?Belgium today is being used as an invasion base against Britain, now fightingfor itslife. And any South American country, in Nazi hands, would always constituteajumping off place for German attack on any one of the other republics ofthis hemisphere.Analyze for yourselves the future of two other places even nearer to Germanyif theNazis won. Could Ireland hold out? Would Irish freedom be permitted asan amazingpet exception in an unfree world? Or the islands of the Azores, which stillfly the flag ofPortugal after five centuries? You and I think of Hawaii as an outpostof defense in thePacific. And yet the Azores are closer to our shores in the Atlantic thanHawaii is onthe other side.There are those who say that the Axis powers would never have any desireto attackthe Western Hemisphere. That is the same dangerous form of wishful thinkingwhichhas destroyed the powers of resistance of so many conquered peoples. Theplainfacts are that the Nazis have proclaimed, time and again, that all otherraces are theirinferiors and therefore subject to their orders. And most important ofall, the vastresources and wealth of this American hemisphere constitute the most temptingloot inall of the round world.Let us no longer blind ourselves to the undeniable fact that the evil forceswhich havecrushed and undermined and corrupted so many others are already withinour owngates. Your government knows much about them and every day is ferretingthem out.Their secret emissaries are active in our own and in neighboring countries.They seekto stir up suspicion and dissension, to cause internal strife. They tryto turn capitalagainst labor, and vice versa. They try to reawaken long slumbering racialand religious enmities which should have no place in this country. They areactive in everygroup that promotes intolerance. They exploit for their own ends our ownnaturalabhorrence of war.These trouble-breeders have but one purpose. It is to divide our people,to dividethem into hostile groups and to destroy our unity and shatter our willto defendourselves.There are also American citizens, many of them in high places, who, unwittinglyinmost cases, are aiding and abetting the work of these agents. I do notcharge theseAmerican citizens with being foreign agents. But I do charge them withdoing exactly the kind of work that the dictators want done in the United States. Thesepeople notonly believe that we can save our own skins by shutting our eyes to thefate of othernations. Some of them go much further than that. They say that we can andshouldbecome the friends and even the partners of the Axis powers. Some of themevensuggest that we should imitate the methods of the dictatorships. But Americansnevercan and never will do that.The experience of the past two years has proven beyond doubt that no nationcanappease the Nazis. No man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it.There can beno appeasement with ruthlessness. There can be no reasoning with an incendiary bomb. We know now that a nation can have peace with the Nazis only at theprice oftotal surrender.Even the people of Italy have been forced to become accomplices of theNazis; but atthis moment they do not know how soon they will be embraced to death bytheir allies.The American appeasers ignore the warning to be found in the fate of Austria,Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, andFrance.They tell you that the Axis powers are going to win anyway; that all ofthis bloodshed inthe world could be saved, that the United States might just as well throwits influenceinto the scale of a dictated peace and get the best out of it that we can.They call it a ""negotiated peace."" Nonsense! Is it a negotiated peace ifa gang ofoutlaws surrounds your community and on threat of extermination makes youpaytribute to save your own skins?For such a dictated peace would be no peace at all. It would be only anotherarmistice,leading to the most gigantic armament race and the most devastating tradewars in allhistory. And in these contests the Americas would offer the only real resistanceto theAxis power. With all their vaunted efficiency, with all their parade ofpious purpose inthis war, there are still in their background the concentration camp andthe servants ofGod in chains.The history of recent years proves that the shootings and the chains andtheconcentration camps are not simply the transient tools but the very altarsof moderndictatorships. They may talk of a ""new order"" in the world, but what theyhave in mindis only a revival of the oldest and the worst tyranny. In that there isno liberty, no religion, nohope. The proposed ""new order"" is the very opposite of a United States of Europeor aUnited States of Asia. It is not a government based upon the consent ofthe governed.It is not a union of ordinary, self-respecting men and women to protectthemselves andtheir freedom and their dignity from oppression. It is an unholy allianceof power andpelf to dominate and to enslave the human race.  The British people and their allies today are conducting an active waragainst thisunholy alliance. Our own future security is greatly dependent on the outcomeof thatfight. Our ability to ""keep out of war"" is going to be affected by thatoutcome. Thinking in terms of today and tomorrow, I make the direct statement tothe Americanpeople that there is far less chance of the United States getting intowar if we do all wecan now to support the nations defending themselves against attack by theAxis than ifwe acquiesce in their defeat, submit tamely to an Axis victory, and waitour turn to bethe object of attack in another war later on. If we are to be completely honest with ourselves, we must admit that thereis risk in anycourse we may take. But I deeply believe that the great majority of ourpeople agreethat the course that I advocate involves the least risk now and the greatesthope for world peace in the future.The people of Europe who are defending themselves do not ask us to do their   fighting. They ask us for the implements of war, the planes, the tanks,the guns, thefreighters which will enable them to fight for their liberty and for oursecurity.Emphatically, we must get these weapons to them, get them to them in sufficientvolume and quickly enough so that we and our children will be saved theagony andsuffering of war which others have had to endure.  Let not the defeatists tell us that it is too late. It will never be earlier.Tomorrow will belater than today. Certain facts are self-evident. In a military sense Great Britain and the British Empire are today thespearhead ofresistance to world conquest. And they are putting up a fight which willlive forever inthe story of human gallantry.There is no demand for sending an American expeditionary force outsideour ownborders. There is no intention by any member of your government to sendsuch aforce. You can therefore, nail, nail any talk about sending armies to Europeasdeliberate untruth.Our national policy is not directed toward war. Its sole purpose is tokeep war awayfrom our country and away from our people.Democracy's fight against world conquest is being greatly aided, and mustbe moregreatly aided, by the rearmament of the United States and by sending everyounceand every ton of munitions and supplies that we can possibly spare to helpthedefenders who are in the front lines. And it is no more un-neutral for usto do that than itis for Sweden, Russia, and other nations near Germany to send steel andore and oiland other war materials into Germany every day in the week.  We are planning our own defense with the utmost urgency, and in its vastscale we must integrate the war needs of Britain and the other free nations whichare resistingaggression.This is not a matter of sentiment or of controversial personal opinion.It is a matter ofrealistic, practical military policy, based on the advice of our militaryexperts who arein close touch with existing warfare. These military and naval expertsand themembers of the Congress and the Administration have a single-minded purpose: thedefense of the United States. This nation is making a great effort to produce everything that is necessaryin thisemergency, and with all possible speed. And this great effort requiresgreat sacrifice.I would ask no one to defend a democracy which in turn would not defendevery one in the nation against want and privation. The strength of this nation shallnot be diluted bythe failure of the government to protect the economic well-being of itscitizens. If our capacity to produce is limited by machines, it must ever be rememberedthatthese machines are operated by the skill and the stamina of the workers.As thegovernment is determined to protect the rights of the workers, so the nationhas a rightto expect that the men who man the machines will discharge their full responsibilitiesto the urgent needs of defense.The worker possesses the same human dignity and is entitled to the samesecurity ofposition as the engineer or the manager or the owner. For the workers providethehuman power that turns out the destroyers, and the planes, and the tanks.The nation expects our defense industries to continue operation withoutinterruption bystrikes or lockouts. It expects and insists that management and workerswill reconciletheir differences by voluntary or legal means, to continue to produce thesupplies thatare so sorely needed.And on the economic side of our great defense program, we are, as you know,bending every effort to maintain stability of prices and with that thestability of the cost of living.Nine days ago I announced the setting up of a more effective organizationto direct ourgigantic efforts to increase the production of munitions. The appropriationof vastsums of money and a well-coordinated executive direction of our defenseefforts arenot in themselves enough. Guns, planes, ships and many other things haveto be builtin the factories and the arsenals of America. They have to be producedby workersand managers and engineers with the aid of machines which in turn haveto be built byhundreds of thousands of workers throughout the land.In this great work there has been splendid cooperation between the governmentandindustry and labor. And I am very thankful.  American industrial genius, unmatched throughout all the world in the solutionofproduction problems, has been called upon to bring its resources and itstalents intoaction. Manufacturers of watches, of farm implements, of Linotypes andcash registersand automobiles, and sewing machines and lawn mowers and locomotives, arenowmaking fuses and bomb packing crates and telescope mounts and shells andpistolsand tanks.But all of our present efforts are not enough. We must have more ships,more guns,more planes -- more of everything. And this can be accomplished only ifwe discard thenotion of ""business as usual."" This job cannot be done merely by superimposingonthe existing productive facilities the added requirements of the nationfor defense.Our defense efforts must not be blocked by those who fear the future consequencesofsurplus plant capacity. The possible consequences of failure of our defenseeffortsnow are much more to be feared.And after the present needs of our defense are past, a proper handlingof the country's peacetime needs will require all of the new productive capacity, if notstill more.No pessimistic policy about the future of America shall delay the immediateexpansionof those industries essential to defense. We need them.  I want to make it clear that it is the purpose of the nation to build nowwith all possiblespeed every machine, every arsenal, every factory that we need to manufactureourdefense material. We have the men, the skill, the wealth, and above all, thewill.I am confident that if and when production of consumer or luxury goodsin certainindustries requires the use of machines and raw materials that are essentialfordefense purposes, then such production must yield, and will gladly yield,to our primaryand compelling purpose.So I appeal to the owners of plants, to the managers, to the workers, to our owngovernment employees to put every ounce of effort into producing thesemunitionsswiftly and without stint. With this appeal I give you the pledge thatall of us who are officers of your government will devote ourselves to the same whole-heartedextent tothe great task that lies ahead.As planes and ships and guns and shells are produced, your government, withitsdefense experts, can then determine how best to use them to defend thishemisphere.The decision as to how much shall be sent abroad and how much shall remainathome must be made on the basis of our overall military necessities.  We must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us this is an emergency as seriousas war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution,the samesense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we wouldshow werewe at war.We have furnished the British great material support and we will furnishfar more in thefuture.There will be no ""bottlenecks"" in our determination to aid Great Britain.No dictator, nocombination of dictators, will weaken that determination by threats ofhow they willconstrue that determination.The British have received invaluable military support from the heroic GreekArmy andfrom the forces of all the governments in exile. Their strength is growing.It is thestrength of men and women who value their freedom more highly than theyvalue theirlives.I believe that the Axis powers are not going   to win this war. I base that belief on the latest and best of information.  We have no excuse for defeatism. We have every good reason for hope   -- hopeforpeace, yes, and hope for the defense of our civilization and for the buildingof a bettercivilization in the future.I have the profound conviction that the American people are now determinedto putforth a mightier effort than they have ever yet made to increase our productionof all theimplements of defense, to meet the threat to our democratic faith.  As President of the United States, I call for that national effort. I callfor it in the name ofthis nation which we love and honor and which we are privileged and proudto serve. Icall upon our people with absolute confidence that our common cause willgreatlysucceed.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.And, Reverend Clergy all, Senator Hawkins, distinguished members of the Florida congressional delegation, and all of you: I can't tell you how you have warmed my heart with your welcome. I'm delighted to be here today.Those of you in the National Association of Evangelicals are known for your spiritual and humanitarian work. And I would be especially remiss if I didn't discharge right now one personal debt of gratitude. Thank you for your prayers. Nancy and I have felt their presence many times in many ways. And believe me, for us they've made all the difference.The other day in the East Room of the White House at a meeting there, someone asked me whether I was aware of all the people out there who were praying for the President. And I had to say, Yes, I am. I've felt it. I believe in intercessionary prayer. But I couldn't help but say to that questioner after he'd asked the question that -- or at least say to them that if sometimes when he was praying he got a busy signal, it was just me in there ahead of him. I think I understand how Abraham Lincoln felt when he said, I have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go. From the joy and the good feeling of this conference, I go to a political reception. Now, I don't know why, but that bit of scheduling reminds me of a story which I'll share with you.An evangelical minister and a politician arrived at Heaven's gate one day together. And St. Peter, after doing all the necessary formalities, took them in hand to show them where their quarters would be. And he took them to a small, single room with a bed, a chair, and a table and said this was for the clergyman. And the politician was a little worried about what might be in store for him. And he couldn't believe it then when St. Peter stopped in front of a beautiful mansion with lovely grounds, many servants, and told him that these would be his quarters.And he couldn't help but ask, he said, But wait, how -- there's something wrong -- how do I get this mansion while that good and holy man only gets a single room? And St. Peter said, You have to understand how things are up here. We've got thousands and thousands of clergy. You're the first politician who ever made it.But I don't want to contribute to a stereotype. So I tell you there are a great many God-fearing, dedicated, noble men and women in public life, present company included. And yes, we need your help to keep us ever-mindful of the ideas and the principles that brought us into the public arena in the first place. The basis of those ideals and principles is a commitment to freedom and personal liberty that, itself is grounded in the much deeper realization that freedom prospers only where the blessings of God are avidly sought and humbly accepted.The American experiment in democracy rests on this insight. Its discovery was the great triumph of our Founding Fathers, voiced by William Penn when he said: If we will not be governed by God, we must be governed by tyrants. Explaining the inalienable rights of men, Jefferson said, The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time. And it was George Washington who said that of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.And finally, that shrewdest of all observers of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville, put it eloquently after he had gone on a search for the secret of America's greatness and genius -- and he said: Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did I understand the greatness and the genius of America. America is good. And if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.Well, I'm pleased to be here today with you who are keeping America great by keeping her good. Only through your work and prayers and those of millions of others can we hope to survive this perilous century and keep alive this experiment in liberty, this last, best hope of man.I want you to know that this administration is motivated by a political philosophy that sees the greatness of America in you, her people, and in your families, churches, neighborhoods, communities: the institutions that foster and nourish values like concern for others and respect for the rule of law under God.Now, I don't have to tell you that this puts us in opposition to, or at least out of step with, a -- a prevailing attitude of many who have turned to a modern-day secularism, discarding the tried and time-tested values upon which our very civilization is based. No matter how well intentioned, their value system is radically different from that of most Americans. And while they proclaim that they're freeing us from superstitions of the past, they've taken upon themselves the job of superintending us by government rule and regulation. Sometimes their voices are louder than ours, but they are not yet a majority.An example of that vocal superiority is evident in a controversy now going on in Washington. And since I'm involved I've been waiting to hear from the parents of young America. How far are they willing to go in giving to government their prerogatives as parents?Let me state the case as briefly and simply as I can. An organization of citizens, sincerely motivated, deeply concerned about the increase in illegitimate births and abortions involving girls well below the age of consent, some time ago established a nationwide network of clinics to offer help to these girls and, hopefully, alleviate this situation. Now, again, let me say, I do not fault their intent. However, in their well-intentioned effort, these clinics decided to provide advice and birth control drugs and devices to underage girls without the knowledge of their parents.For some years now, the federal government has helped with funds to subsidize these clinics. In providing for this, the Congress decreed that every effort would be made to maximize parental participation. Nevertheless, the drugs and devices are prescribed without getting parental consent or giving notification after they've done so. Girls termed sexually active -- and that has replaced the word promiscuous -- are given this help in order to prevent illegitimate birth or abortion.Well, we have ordered clinics receiving federal funds to notify the parents such help has been given. One of the nation's leading newspapers has created the term squeal rule in editorializing against us for doing this, and we're being criticized for violating the privacy of young people. A judge has recently granted an injunction against an enforcement of our rule. I've watched TV panel shows discuss this issue, seen columnists pontificating on our error, but no one seems to mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex.Is all of Judeo-Christian tradition wrong? Are we to believe that something so sacred can be looked upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological harm? And isn't it the parents' right to give counsel and advice to keep their children from making mistakes that may affect their entire lives?Many of us in government would like to know what parents think about this intrusion in their family by government. We're going to fight in the courts. The right of parents and the rights of family take precedence over those of Washington-based bureaucrats and social engineers.But the fight against parental notification is really only one example of many attempts to water down traditional values and even abrogate the original terms of American democracy. Freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under God is acknowledged. When our Founding Fathers passed the First Amendment, they sought to protect churches from government interference. They never intended to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief itself.The evidence of this permeates our history and our government. The Declaration of Independence mentions the Supreme Being no less than four times. In God We Trust is engraved on our coinage. The Supreme Court opens its proceedings with a religious invocation. And the members of Congress open their sessions with a prayer. I just happen to believe the schoolchildren of the United States are entitled to the same privileges as Supreme Court justices and congressmen.Last year, I sent the Congress a constitutional amendment to restore prayer to public schools. Already this session, there's growing bipartisan support for the amendment, and I am calling on the Congress to act speedily to pass it and to let our children pray.Perhaps some of you read recently about the Lubbock school case, where a judge actually ruled that it was unconstitutional for a school district to give equal treatment to religious and nonreligious student groups, even when the group meetings were being held during the students' own time. The First Amendment never intended to require government to discriminate against religious speech.Senators Denton and Hatfield have proposed legislation in the Congress on the whole question of prohibiting discrimination against religious forms of student speech. Such legislation could go far to restore freedom of religious speech for public school students. And I hope the Congress considers these bills quickly. And with your help, I think it's possible we could also get the constitutional amendment through the Congress this year. More than a decade ago, a Supreme Court decision literally wiped off the books of fifty states statutes protecting the rights of unborn children. Abortion on demand now takes the lives of up to one and a half million unborn children a year. Human life legislation ending this tragedy will someday pass the Congress, and you and I must never rest until it does. Unless and until it can be proven that the unborn child is not a living entity, then its right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness must be protected.You may remember that when abortion on demand began, many, and indeed, I'm sure many of you, warned that the practice would lead to a decline in respect for human life, that the philosophical premises used to justify abortion on demand would ultimately be used to justify other attacks on the sacredness of human life -- infanticide or mercy killing. Tragically enough, those warnings proved all too true. Only last year a court permitted the death by starvation of a handicapped infant.I have directed the Health and Human Services Department to make clear to every health care facility in the United States that the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects all handicapped persons against discrimination based on handicaps, including infants. And we have taken the further step of requiring that each and every recipient of federal funds who provides health care services to infants must post and keep posted in a conspicuous place a notice stating that discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infants in this facility is prohibited by federal law. It also lists a twenty-four-hour; toll-free number so that nurses and others may report violations in time to save the infant's life.In addition, recent legislation introduced by -- in the Congress by Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois not only increases restrictions on publicly financed abortions, it also addresses this whole problem of infanticide. I urge the Congress to begin hearings and to adopt legislation that will protect the right of life to all children, including the disabled or handicapped.Now, I'm sure that you must get discouraged at times, but there you've done better than you know, perhaps. There's a great spiritual awakening in America, a renewal of the traditional values that have been the bedrock of America's goodness and greatness.One recent survey by a Washington-based research council concluded that Americans were far more religious than the people of other nations; 95 percent of those surveyed expressed a belief in God and a huge majority believed the Ten Commandments had real meaning in their lives. And another study has found that an overwhelming majority of Americans disapprove of adultery, teenage sex, pornography, abortion, and hard drugs. And this same study showed a deep reverence for the importance of family ties and religious belief.I think the items that we've discussed here today must be a key part of the nation's political agenda. For the first time the Congress is openly and seriously debating and dealing with the prayer and abortion issues and that's enormous progress right there. I repeat: America is in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal. And with your biblical keynote, I say today, Yes, let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream.Now, obviously, much of this new political and social consensus I've talked about is based on a positive view of American history, one that takes pride in our country's accomplishments and record. But we must never forget that no government schemes are going to perfect man. We know that living in this world means dealing with what philosophers would call the phenomenology of evil or, as theologians would put it, the doctrine of sin.There is sin and evil in the world, and we're enjoined by Scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might. Our nation, too, has a legacy of evil with which it must deal. The glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past. For example, the long struggle of minority citizens for equal rights, once a source of disunity and civil war is now a point of pride for all Americans. We must never go back. There is no room for racism, anti-Semitism, or other forms of ethnic and racial hatred in this country.I know that you've been horrified, as have I, by the resurgence of some hate groups preaching bigotry and prejudice. Use the mighty voice of your pulpits and the powerful standing of your churches to denounce and isolate these hate groups in our midst. The commandment given us is clear and simple: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.But whatever sad episodes exist in our past, any objective observer must hold a positive view of American history, a history that has been the story of hopes fulfilled and dreams made into reality. Especially in this century, America has kept alight the torch of freedom, but not just for ourselves but for millions of others around the world.And this brings me to my final point today. During my first press conference as president, in answer to a direct question, I pointed out that, as good Marxist-Leninists, the Soviet leaders have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is that which will further their cause, which is world revolution. I think I should point out I was only quoting Lenin, their guiding spirit, who said in 1920 that they repudiate all morality that proceeds from supernatural ideas -- that's their name for religion -- or ideas that are outside class conceptions. Morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war. And everything is moral that is necessary for the annihilation of the old, exploiting social order and for uniting the proletariat.Well, I think the refusal of many influential people to accept this elementary fact of Soviet doctrine illustrates a historical reluctance to see totalitarian powers for what they are. We saw this phenomenon in the 1930s. We see it too often today.This doesn't mean we should isolate ourselves and refuse to seek an understanding with them. I intend to do everything I can to persuade them of our peaceful intent, to remind them that it was the West that refused to use its nuclear monopoly in the forties and fifties for territorial gain and which now proposes 50 percent cut in strategic ballistic missiles and the elimination of an entire class of land-based, intermediate-range nuclear missiles.At the same time, however, they must be made to understand we will never compromise our principles and standards. We will never give away our freedom. We will never abandon our belief in God. And we will never stop searching for a genuine peace. But we can assure none of these things America stands for through the so-called nuclear freeze solutions proposed by some.The truth is that a freeze now would be a very dangerous fraud, for that is merely the illusion of peace. The reality is that we must find peace through strength.I would agree to a freeze if only we could freeze the Soviets' global desires. A freeze at current levels of weapons would remove any incentive for the Soviets to negotiate seriously in Geneva and virtually end our chances to achieve the major arms reductions which we have proposed. Instead, they would achieve their objectives through the freeze.A freeze would reward the Soviet Union for its enormous and unparalleled military buildup. It would prevent the essential and long overdue modernization of United States and allied defenses and would leave our aging forces increasingly vulnerable. And an honest freeze would require extensive prior negotiations on the systems and numbers to be limited and on the measures to ensure effective verification and compliance. And the kind of a freeze that has been suggested would be virtually impossible to verify. Such a major effort would divert us completely from our current negotiations on achieving substantial reductions.A number of years ago, I heard a young father, a very prominent young man in the entertainment world, addressing a tremendous gathering in California. It was during the time of the cold war, and communism and our own way of life were very much on people's minds. And he was speaking to that subject. And suddenly, though, I heard him saying, I love my little girls more than anything. And I said to myself, Oh, no, don't. You can't -- don't say that. But I had underestimated him. He went on: I would rather see my little girls die now; still believing in God, than have them grow up under communism and one day die no longer believing in God.There were thousands of young people in that audience. They came to their feet with shouts of joy. They had instantly recognized the profound truth in what he had said, with regard to the physical and the soul and what was truly important.Yes, let us pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that totalitarian darkness. Pray they will discover the joy of knowing God. But until they do, let us be aware that while they preach the supremacy of the State, declare its omnipotence over individual man, and predict its eventual domination of all peoples on the earth, they are the focus of evil in the modern world.It was C.S. Lewis who, in his unforgettable Screw Tape Letters, wrote: The greatest evil is not done now in those sordid 'dens of crime' that Dickens loved to paint. It is not even done in concentration camps and labor camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered; moved, seconded, carried and minuted in clear, carpeted, warmed, and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice.Well, because these quiet men do not raise their voices, because they sometimes speak in soothing tones of brotherhood and peace, because, like other dictators before them, they're always making their final territorial demand, some would have us accept them at their word and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulses. But if history teaches anything, it teaches that simpleminded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly. It means the betrayal of our past, the squandering of our freedom.So, I urge you to speak out against those who would place the United States in a position of military and moral inferiority. You know, I've always believed that old Screw Tape reserved his best efforts for those of you in the Church. So, in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride --the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil.I ask you to resist the attempts of those who would have you withhold your support for our efforts, this administration's efforts, to keep America strong and free, while we negotiate real and verifiable reductions in the world's nuclear arsenals and one day, with God's help, their total elimination.While America's military strength is important, let me add here that I've always maintained that the struggle now going on for the world will never be decided by bombs or rockets, by armies or military might. The real crisis we face today is a spiritual one; at root, it is a test of moral will and faith.Whittaker Chambers, the man whose own religious conversion made him a witness to one of the terrible traumas of our time, the Hiss-Chambers case, wrote that the crisis of the Western world exists to the degree in which the West is indifferent to God, the degree to which it collaborates in communism's attempt to make man stand alone without God. And then he said, for Marxism-Leninism is actually the second-oldest faith, first proclaimed in the Garden of Eden with the words of temptation, Ye shall be as gods.The Western world can answer this challenge, he wrote, but only provided that its faith in God and the freedom He enjoins is as great as communism's faith in Man.I believe we shall rise to the challenge. I believe that communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last -- last pages even now are being written. I believe this because the source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material, but spiritual. And because it knows no limitation, it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man. For in the words of Isaiah: He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might He increased strength. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary. Yes, change your world. One of our Founding Fathers, Thomas Paine, said, We have it within our power to begin the world over again. We can do it, doing together what no one church could do by itself.God bless you and thank you very much.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Thank you. Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker OåÕNeill, Reverend  Moomaw, and my fellow citizens:To a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion. And, yet, in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence.  The orderly transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop to think how unique we really  are.  In the eyes of many in the world, this every-four-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition.  By your gracious cooperation in the transition process you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which  guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other. And I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our  republic.The business of our nation goes forward.These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions.  We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling  young and the fixed-income elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people.  Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, human misery and personal indignity.Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes  successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity. But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending. For decades we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our childrenåÕs future for  the temporary convenience of the present.   To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time. Why then should we think that collectively, as a nation, we are  not bound by that same limitation?We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there be no  misunderstanding -- weåÕre going to begin to act beginning today. The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.  They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we have had in the past,  to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.  From time to time weåÕve been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be  managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to  government for, by, and of the people. But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the  capacity to govern someone else?All of us  together -- in and out of government -- must bear the burden. The solutions we seek must be equitable with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.  We hear much of special interest groups. Well our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected.  It knows no sectional boundaries, or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our  streets, man our mines and factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when weåÕre sick -- professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truck drivers. They are, in short, åÒWe the People.åÓ This breed called Americans.  Well, this AdministrationåÕs objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all Americans with no barriers born of bigotry or  discrimination. Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs.All must share in the productive work of this åÒnew beginning,åÓ and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy.With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world.  So as we begin, let us take inventory.We are a nation that has a  government -- not the other way around. And this makes us special among the nations of the earth.  Our Government has no power except that granted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond  the consent of the governed.It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal  Government and those reserved to the states or to the people.All of  us -- all of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the states; the states created the Federal Government.Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, itåÕs not my intention to do away with government.  It is rather to make it work -- work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back.  Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster  productivity, not stifle it. If we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much, prospered as no other  people on earth, it was because here in this land we unleashed the  energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before.Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on earth. The price for this freedom at times has been high,  but we have never been unwilling to pay that price.It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth  of Government.It is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams. We're not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline. I  do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.So with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let us renew  our faith and our hope. We have every right to dream heroic dreams.Those who say that weåÕre in a time when there are no  heroes -- they just donåÕt know where to look. You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates.  Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world  beyond. You meet heroes across a counter -- and theyåÕre on both sides of that counter. There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs,  new wealth and opportunity.There are individuals and families whose taxes support the Government and whose voluntary gifts  support church, charity, culture, art, and education. Their patriotism is quiet but deep. Their values sustain our national life.Now I have used the words åÒtheyåÓ and åÒtheiråÓ in speaking of these heroes. I could say åÒyouåÓ and  åÒyouråÓ because IåÕm addressing the heroes of whom I speak -- you, the  citizens of this blessed land. Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this  Administration, so help me God.We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your make-up. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen -- and loving them reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when theyåÕre sick, and provide opportunity to  make them self-sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?  Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic Yes.  To paraphrase Winston Churchill, I did not take the oath IåÕve just taken with the intention of  presiding over the dissolution of the worldåÕs strongest economy.In the days ahead, I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and  reduced productivity.  Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government. Progress may be  slow -- measured in inches and feet, not miles -- but we will progress. It is time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and  to lighten our punitive tax burden.  And these will be our first priorities, and on these principles there will be no compromise. On the eve or our struggle for independence a man who mightåÕve been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph Warren, president of the  Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow Americans, Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired of. On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide  the important question upon which rest the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves.Well I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what  must be done to insure happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children, and our childrenåÕs children.  And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength  throughout the world. We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon  of hope for those who do not now have freedom.To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen our historic ties and  assure them of our support and firm commitment. We will match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive for mutually beneficial relations. We will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty, for  our own sovereignty is not for sale.As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries, they will be reminded that  peace is the highest aspiration of the American people. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it; we will not surrender for  it -- now or ever. Our forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will.  When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act. We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be, knowing that if we do so, we have the best  chance of never having to use that strength.Above all we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women.  It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans do have.   Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors.   I am -- I'm told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day; and for that I am deeply grateful. We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us  to be free. It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each inaugural day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.This is the first time in our history that this ceremony has been held, as youåÕve been told, on this West Front of the Capitol.Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this cityåÕs special beauty and history.  At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.  Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man. George Washington, father of our country. A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly. He led  America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence.  And then beyond the Reflecting Pool, the dignified columns of the Lincoln Memorial. Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of America will find it in the life  of Abraham Lincoln.Beyond those moments -- those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery, with its row upon row of  simple white markers bearing crosses or Stars of David. They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom.Each one of those markers is a monument to the kind of hero I spoke of earlier.  Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood, the Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno, and halfway around the world on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin  Reservoir, and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.Under one such a marker lies a young man, Martin Treptow, who left his job in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with the famed Rainbow Division.   There, on the Western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy fire. We're told that on his body was found a diary.  On the flyleaf under the heading, åÒMy Pledge,åÓ he had written these words:  America must win this war. Therefore, I will work; I will save; I will sacrifice; I will endure; I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle  depended on me alone.The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make.  It does require, however, our best effort, and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds; to believe that together with  GodåÕs help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us.And after all, why shouldnåÕt we believe that? We are Americans.God bless you and thank you. Thank you very much.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,30,"Franklin Delano Roosevelt - First Fireside Chat   (The Banking Crisis)  Franklin Delano RooseveltFirst Fireside Chat  delivered 12 March 1933, Washington D.C.The Banking Crisis);  "", ""fdrfirstfiresidechat63496436943."");   ; for flash[ Text version   below transcribed directly from audio.]  My friends:I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States aboutbanking -- to talk with the comparatively few who understand the mechanics of banking, but more particularlywith the overwhelming majority of you who use banks for the making of deposits and the drawing of checks.I want to tell you what has been done in the last few days, and why it was done, and what the next steps are going to be. I recognize that the many proclamations from State capitols and from Washington, the legislation, the Treasury regulations, and so forth, couched for the most part in banking and legal terms, ought to be explained for the benefit of the average citizen. I owe this, in particular, because of the fortitude and the good temper with which everybody has accepted the inconvenience and hardships of the banking holiday. And I know that when you understand what we in Washington have been about, I shall continue to have your cooperation as fully as I have had your sympathy and your help during the past week.First of all, let me state the simple fact that when you deposit money in a bank, the bank does not put the money into a safe deposit vault. It invests your money inmany different forms of credit -- in bonds, in commercial paper, in mortgages and in many other kinds of loans. In other words, the bank puts your money to work to keep the wheels ofindustry and of agriculture turning around. A comparatively small part of the money that you put into the bank is kept in currency -- an amount which in normal times is whollysufficient to cover the cash needs of the average citizen. In other words, the total amount of all the currency in the country is only a comparatively small proportion of the total deposits in all the banks of the country.What, then, happened during the last few days of February and the first few days of March? Because of undermined confidence on the part of the public, there was ageneral rush by a large portion of our population to turn bank deposits into currency or gold -- a rush so great that the soundest banks couldn't get enough currency to meetthe demand. The reason for this was that on the spur of the moment it was, of course, impossible to sell perfectly sound assets of a bank and convert them into cash, exceptat panic prices far below their real value. By the afternoon of March third, a week ago last Friday, scarcely a bank in the country was open to do business. Proclamations closing them, in whole or in part, had been issued by theGovernors in almost all the states. It was then that I issued the proclamation providing for the national bank holiday, and this was the first step in the GovernmentåÕs reconstruction of our financial andeconomic fabric.The second step, last Thursday, was the legislation promptly and patriotically passed by the Congress confirming my proclamation and broadening my powers so that it became possiblein view of the requirement of time to extend the holiday and lift the ban of that holiday gradually in the days to come. This law also gave authority to develop a program of rehabilitation of ourbanking facilities. And I want to tell our citizens in every part of the Nation that the national Congress -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- showed by this action a devotion topublic welfare and a realization of the emergency and the necessity for speed that it is difficult to match in all our history.The third stage has been the series of regulations permitting the banks to continue their functions to take care of the distribution of food and household necessities and thepayment of payrolls.This bank holiday, while resulting in many cases in great inconvenience, is affording us the opportunity to supply the currency necessary to meet the situation. Remember that no soundbank is a dollar worse off than it was when it closed its doors last week. Neither is any bank which may turn out not to be in a position for immediate opening. The new lawallows the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks that reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call. The newcurrency is being sent out by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in large volume to every part of the country. It is sound currency because it is backed by actual, goodassets.Another question you will ask is this: Why are all the banks not to be reopened at the same time? The answer is simple and I know you will understand it: Your Government does not intend that the history of thepast few years shall be repeated. We do not want and will not have another epidemic of bank failures.As a result, we start tomorrow, Monday, with the opening of banks in the twelve Federal Reserve Bank cities -- those banks, which on first examination by the Treasury, havealready been found to be all right. That will be followed on Tuesday by the resumption of all other functions by banks already found to be sound in cities where there arerecognized clearing houses. That means about two hundred and fifty cities of the United States. In other words, we are moving as fast as the mechanics of the situation will allow us.On Wednesday and succeeding days, banks in smaller places all through the country will resume business, subject, of course, to the Government's physical ability to complete its survey It is necessary that the reopening of banks beextended over a period in order to permit the banks to make applications for the necessary loans, to obtain currency needed to meet their requirements, and to enable theGovernment to make common sense checkups.Please let me make it clear to you that if your bank does not open the first day you are by no means justified in believing that it will not open. A bank that opens on one of the subsequent days is in exactly the same status as the bank that opens tomorrow.I know that many people are worrying about State banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System. There is no occasion for that worry. These banks can and will receive assistance from member banksand from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. And, of course, they are under the immediate control of the State banking authorities. These State banks are following the same course as the National banks except that they get their licenses to resumebusiness from the State authorities, and these authorities have been asked by the Secretary of the Treasury to permit their good banks to open up on the same scheduleas the national banks. And so I am confident that the State Banking Departments will be as careful as the national Government in the policy relating to the opening of banks andwill follow the same broad theory.It is possible that when the banks resume a very few people who have not recovered from their fear may again begin withdrawals. Let me make it clear to you that the banks willtake care of all needs, except, of course, the hysterical demands of hoarders, and it is my belief that hoarding during the past week has become an exceedingly unfashionable pastime in every part of our nation. It needs no prophet to tell you that whenthe people find that they can get their money -- that they can get it when they want it for all legitimate purposes -- the phantom of fear will soon be laid. People will again beglad to have their money where it will be safely taken care of and where they can use it conveniently at any time. I can assure you, my friends, that it is safer to keep your money in areopened bank than it is to keep it under the mattress.The success of our whole national program depends, of course,  on the cooperation of the public -- on its intelligent support and its use of a reliable system.Remember that the essential accomplishment of the new legislation is that it makes it possible for banks more readily to convert their assets into cash than was the casebefore. More liberal provision has been made for banks to borrow on these assets at the Reserve Banks and more liberal provision has also been made for issuing currencyon the security of these good assets. This currency is not fiat currency. It is issued only on adequate security, and every good bank has an abundance of such security.One more point before I close. There will be, of course, some banks unable to reopen without being reorganized. The new law allows the Government to assist in making thesereorganizations quickly and effectively and even allows the Government to subscribe to at least a part of any new capital that may be required.I hope you can see, my friends, from this essential recital of what your Government is doing that there is nothing complex, nothing radical in the process.We have had a bad banking situation. Some of our bankers had shown themselves either incompetent or dishonest in their handling of the peopleåÕs funds. They had used themoney entrusted to them in speculations and unwise loans. This was, of course, not true in the vast majority of our banks, but it was true in enough of them to shock thepeople of the United States, for a time, into a sense of insecurity and to put them into a frame of mind where they did not differentiate, but seemed to assume that the acts of a comparative fewhad tainted them all. And so it became the GovernmentåÕs job to straighten out this situation and do it as quickly as possible. And that job is being performed.I do not promise you that every bank will be reopened or that individual losses will not be suffered, but there will be no losses that possibly could be avoided; and therewould have been more and greater losses had we continued to drift. I can even promise you salvation for some, at least, of the sorely presses banks. We shall be engagednot merely in reopening sound banks but in the creation of more sound banks through reorganization.It has been wonderful to me to catch the note of confidence from all over the country. I can never be sufficiently grateful to the people for the loyal support that they have givenme in their acceptance of the judgment that has dictated our course, even though all our processes may not have seemed clear to them.After all, there is an element in the readjustment of our financial system more important than currency, more important than gold, and that is the confidence of the people themselves.Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carrying out our plan. You people must have faith; you must not be stampeded by rumors or guesses. Let usunite in banishing fear. We have provided the machinery to restore our financial system, and it is up to you to support and make it work.It is your problem, my friends, your problem no less than it is mine.Together we cannot fail.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,31,"Harry S. Truman - ""The Truman Doctrine""Harry S. TrumanThe Truman Doctrine   delivered 12 March 1947 before a Joint Session   of Congress  );  "", ""harrytrumandoctrine456344423."");   ; for flash[  fromaudio.]Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress of the United States:  The gravity of the situation which confronts the world today necessitatesmy appearance before a joint session of the Congress. The foreign policyand the national security of this country are involved. One aspect of thepresent situation, which I present to you at this time for your considerationand decision, concerns Greece and Turkey. The United States has receivedfrom the Greek Government an urgent appeal for financial and economic assistance.Preliminary reports from the American Economic Mission now in Greece andreports from the American Ambassador in Greece corroborate the statementof the Greek Government that assistance is imperative if Greece is to surviveas a free nation. I do not believe that the American people and the Congress wish to turna deaf ear to the appeal of the Greek Government. Greece is not a richcountry. Lack of sufficient natural resources has always forced theGreek people to work hard to make both ends meet. Since 1940, this industrious,peace loving country has suffered invasion, four years of cruel enemy occupation,and bitter internal strife. When forces of liberation entered Greece they found that the retreatingGermans had destroyed virtually all the railways, roads, port facilities,communications, and merchant marine. More than a thousand villages hadbeen burned. Eighty-five percent of the children were tubercular. Livestock,poultry, and draft animals had almost disappeared. Inflation had wipedout practically all savings. As a result of these tragic conditions, amilitant minority, exploiting human want and misery, was able to createpolitical chaos which, until now, has made economic recovery impossible. Greece is today without funds to finance the importation of those goodswhich are essential to bare subsistence. Under these circumstances, thepeople of Greece cannot make progress in solving their problems of reconstruction.Greece is in desperate need of financial and economic assistance to enableit to resume purchases of food, clothing, fuel, and seeds. These are indispensablefor the subsistence of its people and are obtainable only from abroad.Greece must have help to import the goods necessary to restore internalorder and security, so essential for economic and political recovery. TheGreek Government has also asked for the assistance of experienced Americanadministrators, economists, and technicians to insure that the financialand other aid given to Greece shall be used effectively in creating a stableand self-sustaining economy and in improving its public administration. The very existence of the Greek state is today threatened by the terroristactivities of several thousand armed men, led by Communists, who defy thegovernment's authority at a number of points, particularly along the northernboundaries. A Commission appointed by the United Nations security Councilis at present investigating disturbed conditions in northern Greece andalleged border violations along the frontiers between Greece on the onehand and Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia on the other. Meanwhile, the Greek Government is unable to cope with the situation.The Greek army is small and poorly equipped. It needs supplies and equipmentif it is to restore authority of the government throughout Greek territory.Greece must have assistance if it is to become a self-supporting and self-respectingdemocracy. The United States must supply this assistance. We have alreadyextended to Greece certain types of relief and economic aid. But theseare inadequate. There is no other country to which democratic Greece canturn. No other nation is willing and able to provide the necessary supportfor a democratic Greek government. The British Government, which has been helping Greece, can give no furtherfinancial or economic aid after March 31st. Great Britain finds itselfunder the necessity of reducing or liquidating its commitments in severalparts of the world, including Greece. We have considered how the United Nations might assist in this crisis.But the situation is an urgent one, requiring immediate action, and theUnited Nations and its related organizations are not in a position to extendhelp of the kind that is required. It is important to note that the Greek Government has asked for ouraid in utilizing effectively the financial and other assistance we maygive to Greece, and in improving its public administration. It is of theutmost importance that we supervise the use of any funds made availableto Greece in such a manner that each dollar spent will count toward makingGreece self-supporting, and will help to build an economy in which a healthydemocracy can flourish. No government is perfect. One of the chief virtues of a democracy, however,is that its defects are always visible and under democratic processes canbe pointed out and corrected. The Government of Greece is not perfect.Nevertheless it represents eighty-five percent of the members of the GreekParliament who were chosen in an election last year. Foreign observers,including 692 Americans, considered this election to be a fair expressionof the views of the Greek people. The Greek Government has been operating in an atmosphere of chaos andextremism. It has made mistakes. The extension of aid by this country doesnot mean that the United States condones everything that the Greek Governmenthas done or will do. We have condemned in the past, and we condemn now,extremist measures of the right or the left. We have in the past advisedtolerance, and we advise tolerance now. Greek's [sic] neighbor, Turkey, also deserves our attention. The futureof Turkey, as an independent and economically sound state, is clearly noless important to the freedom-loving peoples of the world than the futureof Greece. The circumstances in which Turkey finds itself today are considerablydifferent from those of Greece. Turkey has been spared the disasters thathave beset Greece. And during the war, the United States and Great Britainfurnished Turkey with material aid. Nevertheless, Turkey now needs our support. Since the war, Turkey hassought additional financial assistance from Great Britain and the United States forthe purpose of effecting that modernization necessary for the maintenanceof its national integrity. That integrity is essential to the preservationof order in the Middle East. The British government has informed us that,owing to its own difficulties, it can no longer extend financial or economicaid to Turkey. As in the case of Greece, if Turkey is to have the assistanceit needs, the United States must supply it. We are the only country ableto provide that help. I am fully aware of the broad implications involved if the United Statesextends assistance to Greece and Turkey, and I shall discuss these implicationswith you at this time. One of the primary objectives of the foreign policyof the United States is the creation of conditions in which we and othernations will be able to work out a way of life free from coercion. Thiswas a fundamental issue in the war with Germany and Japan. Our victorywas won over countries which sought to impose their will, and their wayof life, upon other nations. To ensure the peaceful development of nations, free from coercion, theUnited States has taken a leading part in establishing the United Nations.The United Nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and independencefor all its members. We shall not realize our objectives, however, unlesswe are willing to help free peoples to maintain their free institutionsand their national integrity against aggressive movements that seek toimpose upon them totalitarian regimes. This is no more than a frank recognitionthat totalitarian regimes imposed upon free peoples, by direct or indirectaggression, undermine the foundations of international peace, and hencethe security of the United States. The peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently hadtotalitarian regimes forced upon them against their will. The Governmentof the United States has made frequent protests against coercion and intimidationin violation of the Yalta agreement in Poland, Rumania, and Bulgaria. Imust also state that in a number of other countries there have been similardevelopments. At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choosebetween alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one.One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguishedby free institutions, representative government, free elections, guaranteesof individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom frompolitical oppression. The second way of life is based upon the will ofa minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror andoppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppressionof personal freedoms. I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to supportfree peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minoritiesor by outside pressures. I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destiniesin their own way. I believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financialaid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes.The world is not static, and the status quo is not sacred. Butwe cannot allow changes in the status quo in violation of the Charter ofthe United Nations by such methods as coercion, or by such subterfugesas political infiltration. In helping free and independent nations to maintaintheir freedom, the United States will be giving effect to the principlesof the Charter of the United Nations. It is necessary only to glance at a map to realize that the survivaland integrity of the Greek nation are of grave importance in a much widersituation. If Greece should fall under the control of an armed minority,the effect upon its neighbor, Turkey, would be immediate and serious. Confusionand disorder might well spread throughout the entire Middle East. Moreover,the disappearance of Greece as an independent state would have a profoundeffect upon those countries in Europe whose peoples are struggling againstgreat difficulties to maintain their freedoms and their independence whilethey repair the damages of war. It would be an unspeakable tragedy if these countries, which have struggledso long against overwhelming odds, should lose that victory for which theysacrificed so much. Collapse of free institutions and loss of independencewould be disastrous not only for them but for the world. Discouragementand possibly failure would quickly be the lot of neighboring peoples strivingto maintain their freedom and independence. Should we fail to aid Greece and Turkey in this fateful hour, the effectwill be far reaching to the West as well as to the East. We must take immediate and resolute action. I therefore ask the Congressto provide authority for assistance to Greece and Turkey in the amountof $400,000,000 for the period ending June 30, 1948. In requesting thesefunds, I have taken into consideration the maximum amount of relief assistancewhich would be furnished to Greece out of the $350,000,000 which I recentlyrequested that the Congress authorize for the prevention of starvationand suffering in countries devastated by the war. In addition to funds, I ask the Congress to authorize the detail ofAmerican civilian and military personnel to Greece and Turkey, at the requestof those countries, to assist in the tasks of reconstruction, and for thepurpose of supervising the use of such financial and material assistanceas may be furnished. I recommend that authority also be provided for theinstruction and training of selected Greek and Turkish personnel. Finally,I ask that the Congress provide authority which will permit the speediestand most effective use, in terms of needed commodities, supplies, and equipment,of such funds as may be authorized. If further funds, or further authority,should be needed for the purposes indicated in this message, I shall not hesitateto bring the situation before the Congress. On this subject the Executiveand Legislative branches of the Government must work together. This is a serious course upon which we embark. I would not recommendit except that the alternative is much more serious. The United Statescontributed $341,000,000,000 toward winning World War II. This is an investmentin world freedom and world peace. The assistance that I am recommendingfor Greece and Turkey amounts to little more than 1 tenth of 1 percentof this investment. It is only common sense that we should safeguard thisinvestment and make sure that it was not in vain. The seeds of totalitarianregimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evilsoil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hopeof a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. The free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintainingtheir freedoms. If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peaceof the world. And we shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation. Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movementof events. I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.Book/CDs by Michael E. Eidenmuller, Published by McGraw-Hill (2008)  Also in this   database: George C.

Faulkner - Speech Accepting the Nobel Prize inLiteratureWilliam FaulknerSpeech Accepting the Nobel Prize inLiteratureoriginally  delivered December 10, 1950 in Stockholm Sweden  Plug-in required for flash audiovar so = new    (,""playlistfaulkner."")   ;[  fromaudio version #2.]I feel that this award was not made to me as a man, but to my work -- a life's work in the agony and sweat of the human spirit, not for glory and least of all for profit, but to create out of the materials of the human spirit something which did not exist before. So this award is only mine in trust. It will not be difficult to find a dedication for the money part of it commensurate with the purpose and significance of its origin. But I would like to do the same with the acclaim too, by using this moment as a pinnacle from which I might be listened to by the young men and women already dedicated to the same anguish and travail, among whom is already that one who will some day stand here where I am standing.Our tragedy today is a general and universal physical fear so longsustained by now that we can even bear it. There are no longer problems of the spirit.There is only the question: When will I be blown up? Because of this, the young man orwoman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itselfwhich alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth theagony and the sweat.He must learn them again. He must teach himself that the basest ofall things is to be afraid; and, teaching himself that, forget it forever, leaving no roomin his workshop for anything but the old verities and truths of the heart, the old universaltruths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed -- love and honor and pity andpride and compassion and sacrifice. Until he does so, he labors under a curse. He writesnot of love but of lust, of defeats in which nobody loses anything of value, of victorieswithout hope and, worst of all, without pity or compassion. His griefs grieve on nouniversal bones, leaving no scars. He writes not of the heart but of the glands.Until he relearns these things, he will write as though he stood amongand watched the end of man. I decline to accept the end of man. It is easy enough to saythat man is immortal simply because he will endure: that when the last ding-dong of doomhas clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red anddying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his punyinexhaustible voice, still talking. I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will notmerely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures hasan inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion andsacrifice and endurance.The poet&#146;s, the writer's, duty is to write about these things.It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of thecourage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have beenthe glory of his past. The poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can beone of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,33," Eugene Debs - Plea to the CourtEugene DebsStatement to the Court delivered 14 [or 18] September 1918, Federal Court of Cleveland, Ohio for flashYour Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free. I listened to all that was said in this court in support and justification of this prosecution, but my mind remains unchanged. I look upon the Espionage Law as a despotic enactment in flagrant conflict with democratic principles and with the spirit of free institutions...Your Honor, I have stated in this court that I am opposed to the social system in which we live; that I believe in a fundamental change -- but if possible by peaceable and orderly means...Standing here this morning, I recall my boyhood. At fourteen I went to work in a railroad shop; at sixteen I was firing a freight engine on a railroad. I remember all the hardships and privations of that earlier day, and from that time until now my heart has been with the working class. I could have been in Congress long ago. I have preferred to go to prison...I am thinking this morning of the men in the mills and the factories; of the men in the mines and on the railroads. I am thinking of the women who for a paltry wage are compelled to work out their barren lives; of the little children who in this system are robbed of their childhood and in their tender years are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the monster machines while they themselves are being starved and stunted, body and soul. I see them dwarfed and diseased and their little lives broken and blasted because in this high noon of Christian civilization money is still so much more important than the flesh and blood of childhood. In very truth gold is god today and rules with pitiless sway in the affairs of men. In this country -- the most favored beneath the bending skies -- we have vast areas of the richest and most fertile soil, material resources in inexhaustible abundance, the most marvelous productive machinery on earth, and millions of eager workers ready to apply their labor to that machinery to produce in abundance for every man, woman, and child -- and if there are still vast numbers of our people who are the victims of poverty and whose lives are an unceasing struggle all the way from youth to old age, until at last death comes to their rescue and lulls these hapless victims to dreamless sleep, it is not the fault of the Almighty: it cannot be charged to nature, but it is due entirely to the outgrown social system in which we live that ought to be abolished not only in the interest of the toiling masses but in the higher interest of all humanity...I believe, Your Honor, in common with all Socialists, that this nation ought to own and control its own industries. I believe, as all Socialists do, that all things that are jointly needed and used ought to be jointly owned -- that industry, the basis of our social life, instead of being the private property of a few and operated for their enrichment, ought to be the common property of all, democratically administered in the interest of all...I am opposing a social order in which it is possible for one man who does absolutely nothing that is useful to amass a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars, while millions of men and women who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough for a wretched existence. This order of things cannot always endure. I have registered my protest against it. I recognize the feebleness of my effort, but, fortunately, I am not alone. There are multiplied thousands of others who, like myself, have come to realize that before we may truly enjoy the blessings of civilized life, we must reorganize society upon a mutual and cooperative basis; and to this end we have organized a great economic and political movement that spreads over the face of all the earth. There are today upwards of sixty millions of Socialists, loyal, devoted adherents to this cause, regardless of nationality, race, creed, color, or sex. They are all making common cause. They are spreading with tireless energy the propaganda of the new social order. They are waiting, watching, and working hopefully through all the hours of the day and the night. They are still in a minority. But they have learned how to be patient and to bide their time. They feel -- they know, indeed -- that the time is coming, in spite of all opposition, all persecution, when this emancipating gospel will spread among all the peoples, and when this minority will become the triumphant majority and, sweeping into power, inaugurate the greatest social and economic change in history. In that day we shall have the universal commonwealth -- the harmonious cooperation of every nation with every other nation on earth...Your Honor, I ask no mercy and I plead for no immunity. I realize that finally the right must prevail. I never so clearly comprehended as now the great struggle between the powers of greed and exploitation on the one hand and upon the other the rising hosts of industrial freedom and social justice. I can see the dawn of the better day for humanity. The people are awakening. In due time they will and must come to their own. When the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, looks for relief from his weary watch, he turns his eyes toward the southern cross, burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight approaches, the southern cross begins to bend, the whirling worlds change their places, and with starry fingerpoints the Almighty marks the passage of time upon the dial of the universe, and though no bell may beat the glad tidings, the lookout knows that the midnight is passing and that relief and rest are close at hand. Let the people everywhere take heart of hope, for the cross is bending, the midnight is passing, and joy cometh with the morning. I am now prepared to receive your sentence.Book/CDs by Michael E.

This is truly a celebration, a celebration of the contributions women make in every aspect of life: in the home, on the job, in the community, as mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, learners, workers, citizens, and leaders.It is also a coming together, much the way women come together every day in every country. We come together in fields and factories, in village markets and supermarkets, in living rooms and board rooms. Whether it is while playing with our children in the park, or washing clothes in a river, or taking a break at the office water cooler, we come together and talk about our aspirations and concern. And time and again, our talk turns to our children and our families. However different we may appear, there is far more that unites us than divides us. We share a common future, and we are here to find common ground so that we may help bring new dignity and respect to women and girls all over the world, and in so doing bring new strength and stability to families as well.By gathering in Beijing, we are focusing world attention on issues that matter most in our lives -- the lives of women and their families: access to education, health care, jobs and credit, the chance to enjoy basic legal and human rights and to participate fully in the political life of our countries.There are some who question the reason for this conference. Let them listen to the voices of women in their homes, neighborhoods, and workplaces. There are some who wonder whether the lives of women and girls matter to economic and political progress around the globe. Let them look at the women gathered here and at Huairou -- the homemakers and nurses, the teachers and lawyers, the policymakers and women who run their own businesses. It is conferences like this that compel governments and peoples everywhere to listen, look, and face the worldåÕs most pressing problems. WasnåÕt it after all -- after the womenåÕs conference in Nairobi ten years ago that the world focused for the first time on the crisis of domestic violence?Earlier today, I participated in a World Health Organization forum. In that forum, we talked about ways that government officials, NGOs, and individual citizens are working to address the health problems of women and girls. Tomorrow, I will attend a gathering of the United Nations Development Fund for Women. There, the discussion will focus on local -- and highly successful -- programs that give hard-working women access to credit so they can improve their own lives and the lives of their families.What we are learning around the world is that if women are healthy and educated, their families will flourish. If women are free from violence, their families will flourish. If women have a chance to work and earn as full and equal partners in society, their families will flourish. And when families flourish, communities and nations do as well. That is why every woman, every man, every child, every family, and every nation on this planet does have a stake in the discussion that takes place here.Over the past 25 years, I have worked persistently on issues relating to women, children, and families. Over the past two and a half years, I've had the opportunity to learn more about the challenges facing women in my own country and around the world.I have met new mothers in Indonesia, who come together regularly in their village to discuss nutrition, family planning, and baby care. I have met working parents in Denmark who talk about the comfort they feel in knowing that their children can be cared for in safe, and nurturing after-school centers. I have met women in South Africa who helped lead the struggle to end apartheid and are now helping to build a new democracy. I have met with the leading women of my own hemisphere who are working every day to promote literacy and better health care for  children in their countries. I have met women in India and Bangladesh who are taking out small loans to buy milk cows, or rickshaws, or thread in order to create a livelihood for themselves and their families. I have met the doctors and nurses in Belarus and Ukraine who are trying to keep children alive in the aftermath of Chernobyl.The great challenge of this conference is to give voice to women everywhere whose experiences go unnoticed, whose words go unheard. Women comprise more than half the worldåÕs population, 70% of the worldåÕs poor, and two-thirds of those who are not taught to read and write. We are the primary caretakers for most of the worldåÕs children and elderly. Yet much of the work we do is not valued -- not by economists, not by historians, not by popular culture, not by government leaders.At this very moment, as we sit here, women around the world are giving birth, raising children, cooking meals, washing clothes, cleaning houses, planting crops, working on assembly lines, running companies, and running countries. Women also are dying from diseases that should have been prevented or treated. They are watching their children succumb to malnutrition caused by poverty and economic deprivation. They are being denied the right to go to school by their own fathers and brothers. They are being forced into prostitution, and they are being barred from the bank lending offices and banned from the ballot box.Those of us who have the opportunity to be here have the responsibility to speak for those who could not. As an American, I want to speak for those women in my own country, women who are raising children on the minimum wage, women who canåÕt afford health care or child care, women whose lives are threatened by violence, including violence in their own homes.I want to speak up for mothers who are fighting for good schools, safe neighborhoods, clean air, and clean airwaves; for older women, some of them widows, who find that, after raising their families, their skills and life experiences are not valued in the marketplace; for women who are working all night as nurses, hotel clerks, or fast food chefs so that they can be at home during the day with their children; and for women everywhere who simply donåÕt have time to do everything they are called upon to do each and every day.Speaking to you today, I speak for them, just as each of us speaks for women around the world who are denied the chance to go to school, or see a doctor, or own property, or have a say about the direction of their lives, simply because they are women. The truth is that most women around the world work both inside and outside the home, usually by necessity.We need to understand there is no one formula for how women should lead our lives. That is why we must respect the choices that each woman makes for herself and her family. Every woman deserves the chance to realize her own God-given potential. But we must recognize that women will never gain full dignity until their human rights are respected and protected.Our goals for this conference, to strengthen families and societies by empowering women to take greater control over their own destinies, cannot be fully achieved unless all governments -- here and around the world -- accept their responsibility to protect and promote internationally recognized human rights. The -- The international community has long acknowledged and recently reaffirmed at Vienna that both women and men are entitled to a range of protections and personal freedoms, from the right of personal security to the right to determine freely the number and spacing of the children they bear. No one -- No one should be forced to remain silent for fear of religious or political persecution, arrest, abuse, or torture.Tragically, women are most often the ones whose human rights are violated. Even now, in the late 20th century, the rape of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed conflict. Women and children make up a large majority of the worldåÕs refugees. And when women are excluded from the political process, they become even more vulnerable to abuse. I believe that now, on the eve of a new millennium, it is time to break the silence. It is time for us to say here in Beijing, and for the world to hear, that it is no longer acceptable to discuss womenåÕs rights as separate from human rights.These abuses have continued because, for too long, the history of women has been a history of silence. Even today, there are those who are trying to silence our words. But the voices of this conference and of the women at Huairou must be heard loudly and clearly:It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food, or drowned, or suffocated, or their spines broken, simply because they are born girls.It is a violation of human rights when women and girls are sold into the slavery of prostitution for human greed -- and the kinds of reasons that are used to justify this practice should no longer be tolerated.It is a violation of human rights when women are doused with gasoline, set on fire, and burned to death because their marriage dowries are deemed too small.It is a violation of human rights when individual women are raped in their own communities and when thousands of women are subjected to rape as a tactic or prize of war.It is a violation of human rights when a leading cause of death worldwide among women ages 14 to 44 is the violence they are subjected to in their own homes by their own relatives.It is a violation of human rights when young girls are brutalized by the painful and degrading practice of genital mutilation.It is a violation of human rights when women are denied the right to plan their own families, and that includes being forced to have abortions or being sterilized against their will.If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are womenåÕs rights and womenåÕs rights are human rights once and for all. Let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely -- and the right to be heard.Women must enjoy the rights to participate fully in the social and political lives of their countries, if we want freedom and democracy to thrive and endure. It is indefensible that many women in nongovernmental organizations who wished to participate in this conference have not been able to attend -- or have been prohibited from fully taking part.Let me be clear. Freedom means the right of people to assemble, organize, and debate openly. It means respecting the views of those who may disagree with the views of their governments. It means not taking citizens away from their loved ones and jailing them, mistreating them, or denying them their freedom or dignity because of the peaceful expression of their ideas and opinions.In my country, we recently celebrated the 75th anniversary of WomenåÕs Suffrage. It took 150 years after the signing of ourDeclaration of Independence for women to win the right to vote. It took 72 years of organized struggle, before that happened, on the part of many courageous women and men. It was one of AmericaåÕs most divisive philosophical wars. But it was a bloodless war. Suffrage was achieved without a shot being fired.But we have also been reminded, in V-J Day observances last weekend, of the good that comes when men and women join together to combat the forces of tyranny and to build a better world. We have seen peace prevail in most places for a half century. We have avoided another world war. But we have not solved older, deeply-rooted problems that continue to diminish the potential of half the worldåÕs population.Now it is the time to act on behalf of women everywhere. If we take bold steps to better the lives of women, we will be taking bold steps to better the lives of children and families too. Families rely on mothers and wives for emotional support and care. Families rely on women for labor in the home. And increasingly, everywhere, families rely on women for income needed to raise healthy children and care for other relatives.As long as discrimination and inequities remain so commonplace everywhere in the world, as long as girls and women are valued less, fed less, fed last, overworked, underpaid, not schooled, subjected to violence in and outside their homes -- the potential of the human family to create a peaceful, prosperous world will not be realized.Let -- Let this conference be our -- and the worldåÕs -- call to action. Let us heed that call so we can create a world in which every woman is treated with respect and dignity, every boy and girl is loved and cared for equally, and every family has the hope of a strong and stable future. That is the work before you. That is the work before all of us who have a vision of the world we want to see -- for our children and our grandchildren.The time is now. We must move beyond rhetoric. We must move beyond recognition of problems to working together, to have the comment efforts to build that common ground we hope to see. God's blessing on you, your work, and all who will benefit from it. Godspeed and thank you very much.Book/CDs by Michael E.

(2)]Madam President, Members of the General Assembly:WhenSecretary General HammarskjoldåÕs invitation to address this General Assembly reached me in Bermuda, I was just beginning a series of conferences with the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of Great Britain and of France. Our subject was some of the problems that beset our world.During the remainder of the Bermuda Conference, I had constantly in mind that ahead of me lay a great honor. That honor is mine today, as I stand here, privileged to address the General Assembly of the United Nations.At thesame time that I appreciate the distinction of addressing you, I have a sense ofexhilaration as I look upon this Assembly. Never before in history has so muchhope for so many people been gathered together in a single organization. Yourdeliberations and decisions during these somber years have already realized partof those hopes.But thegreat tests and the great accomplishments still lie ahead. And in the confident expectation of those accomplishments, I would usethe office which, for the time being, I hold, to assure you that the Governmentof the United States will remain steadfast in its support of this body. This we shall do in the conviction that you will provide a great share ofthe wisdom, of the courage, and the faith which can bring to this world lastingpeace for all nations, and happiness and well-being for all men.Clearly,it would not be fitting for me to take this occasion to present to you aunilateral American report on Bermuda.Nevertheless, I assure you that in our deliberations on that lovely island we sought to invoke those same great concepts of universal peace and human dignity which are so cleanly etched in your Charter. Neither would it be a measure of this great opportunity merely to recite, however hopefully, pious platitudes.I therefore decided that this occasion warranted my saying to you some of the things that have been on the minds and hearts of my legislative and executive associates, and on mine, for a great many months -- thoughts I had originally planned to say primarily to the American people.I know that the American people share my deep belief that if a danger exists in the world, it is a danger shared by all; and equally, that if hope exists in the mind of one nation, that hope should be shared by all.Finally, if there is to be advanced any proposal designed to ease even by the smallest measure the tensions of todayåÕs world, what more appropriate audience could there be than the members of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I feel impelled to speak today in a language that in a sense is new, one which I, who have spent so much of my life in the military profession, would have preferred never to use. That new language is the language of atomic warfare.The atomicage has moved forward at such a pace that every citizen of the world should havesome comprehension, at least in comparative terms, of the extent of thisdevelopment, of the utmost significance to everyone of us. Clearly, if thepeoples of the world are to conduct an intelligent search for peace, they mustbe armed with the significant facts of todayåÕs existence.My recitalof atomic danger and power is necessarily stated in United States terms, forthese are the only incontrovertible facts that I know. I need hardly point outto this Assembly, however, that this subject is global, not merely national incharacter.On July 16, 1945, the United States set off the worldåÕs first atomic explosion.Since that date in 1945, the United States of America has conducted forty-two test explosions. Atomic bombs today are more than twenty-five times as powerful as the weapons with which the atomic age dawned, while hydrogen weapons are in the ranges of millions of tons of TNT equivalent.Today, the United States stockpile of atomic weapons, which, of course, increases daily, exceeds by many times the total [explosive] equivalent of the total of all bombs and all shells that came from every plane and every gun in every theatre of war in all the years of World War II.A single air group, whether afloat or land based, can now deliver to any reachable target a destructive cargo exceeding in power all the bombs that fell on Britain in all of World War II. In size and variety, the development of atomic weapons has been no less remarkable. The development has been such that atomic weapons have virtually achieved conventional status within our armed services.In the United States, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps are all capable of putting this weapon to military use. But the dread secret and the fearful engines of atomic might are not ours alone.In the first place, the secret is possessed by our friends and allies,  Great Britain and Canada, whose scientific genius made a tremendous contribution to our original discoveries and the designs of atomic bombs.The secret is also known by the Soviet Union.The Soviet Union has informed us that, over recent years, it has devoted extensive resources to atomic weapons. During this period the Soviet Union has exploded a series of atomic advices -- devices, including at least one involving thermo-nuclear reactions. If at one time the Unites States possessed what might have been called a monopoly of atomic power, that monopoly ceased to exist several years ago.Therefore, although our earlier start has permitted us to accumulate what is today a great quantitative advantage, the atomic realities of today comprehend two facts of even greater significance.First, the knowledge now possessed by several nations will eventually be shared by others, possibly all others.Second,even a vast superiority in numbers of weapons, and a consequent capability ofdevastating retaliation, is no preventive, of itself, against the fearfulmaterial damage and toll of human lives that would be inflicted by surpriseaggression. The freeworld, at least dimly aware of these facts, has naturally embarked on a largeprogram of warning and defense systems. That program will be accelerated andexpanded. But let no one think that the expenditure of vast sums for weapons andsystems of defense can guarantee absolute safety for the cities and citizens ofany nation. The awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb does not permit of any sucheasy solution. Even against the most powerful defense, an aggressor inpossession of the effective minimum number of atomic bombs for a surprise attackcould probably place a sufficient number of his bombs on the chosen targets tocause hideous damage.Shouldsuch an atomic attack be launched against the United States, our reactions wouldbe swift and resolute. But for me to say that the defense capabilities of theUnited States are such that they could inflict terrible losses upon anaggressor, for me to say that the retaliation capabilities of the Unites Statesare so great that such an aggressoråÕs land would be laid waste, all this,while fact, is not the true expression of the purpose and the hope of theUnited States.To pausethere would be to confirm the hopeless finality of a belief that two atomiccolossi are doomed malevolently to eye each other indefinitely across atrembling world. To stop there would be to accept hope -- helplessly the probability ofcivilization destroyed, the annihilation of the irreplaceable heritage ofmankind handed down to use generation from generation, and the condemnation ofmankind to begin all over again the age-old struggle upward from savagerytoward decency, and right, and justice. Surely no sane member of the human racecould discover victory in such desolation.Could anyone wish his name to be coupled by history with such human degradation and destruction? Occasional pages of history do record the faces of the åÒgreat destroyers,åÓ but the whole book of history reveals mankindåÕs never-ending quest for peace and mankindåÕs God-given capacity to build.It is withthe book of history, and not with isolated pages, that the United States willever wish to be identified. My country wants to be constructive, notdestructive. It wants agreements, not wars, among nations. It wants itself tolive in freedom and in the confidence that the people of every other nationenjoy equally the right of choosing their own way of life.So mycountryåÕs purpose is to help us move out of the dark chamber of horrorsinto the light, to find a way by which the minds of men, the hopes of men, thesouls of men everywhere, can move forward toward peace and happiness andwell-being.In thisquest, I know that we must not lack patience. I know that in a world divided,such as ours today, salvation cannot be attained by one dramatic act.I know that many steps will have to be taken over many months before theworld can look at itself one day and truly realize that a new climate ofmutually peaceful confidence is abroad in the world. But I know, above all else,that we must start to take these steps now.The UnitedStates and its allies, Great Britain and France, have, over the past months,tried to take some of these steps. Let no one say that we shun the conferencetable. On the record has long stood the request of the United States, Great Britain, and France to negotiate with the Soviet Union the problems of adivided Germany. On that record has long stood the request of the same threenations to negotiate an Austrian peace treaty. On the same record still standsthe request of the United Nations to negotiate the problems of Korea.Mostrecently we have received from the Soviet Union what is in effect an expressionof willingness to hold a four-Power meeting. Along with our allies, GreatBritain and France, we were pleased to see that his note did not contain theunacceptable pre-conditions previously put forward. As you already know from ourjoint Bermuda communiquÌ©, the United States, Great Britain, and France haveagreed promptly to meet with the Soviet Union.TheGovernment of the United States approaches this conference with hopefulsincerity. We will bend every effort of our minds to the single purpose ofemerging from that conference with tangible results towards peace, the only trueway of lessening international tension. We never have, we never will, proposeor suggest that the Soviet Union surrender what is rightfully theirs. We will neversay that the people of Russia are an enemy with whom we have no desire everto deal or mingle in friendly and fruitful relationship.On thecontrary, we hope that this coming conference may initiate a relationship withthe Soviet Union which will eventually bring about a free intermingling of thepeoples of the East and of the West -- the one sure, human way of developing theunderstanding required for confident and peaceful relations.Instead ofthe discontent which is now settling upon Eastern Germany, occupied Austria, andthe countries of Eastern Europe, we seek a harmonious family of free Europeannations, with none a threat to the other, and least of all a threat to thepeoples of the Russia. Beyond the turmoil and strife and misery of Asia, we seekpeaceful opportunity for these peoples to develop their natural resources and toelevate their lives.These arenot idle words or shallow visions. Behind them lies a story of nations latelycome to independence, not as a result of war, but through free grant or peacefulnegotiation. There is a record already written of assistance gladly given bynations of the West to needy peoples and to those suffering the temporaryeffects of famine, drought, and natural disaster. These are deeds of peace. Theyspeak more loudly than promises or protestations of peaceful intent.But I donot wish to rest either upon the reiteration of past proposals or therestatement of past deeds. The gravity of the time is such that every new avenueof peace, no matter how dimly discernible, should be explored. There is at leastone new avenue of peace which has not yet been well explored -- an avenue now laidout by the General Assembly of the Unites Nations.In itsresolution of November 18th, 1953 this General Assembly suggested -- and I quote --åÒthat the Disarmament Commission study the desirability of establishing a sub-committee consisting of representatives of the Powers principally involved,which should seek in private an acceptable solution and report such asolution to the General Assembly and to the Security Council not later thanSeptember 1, of 1954.åÓThe UnitedStates, heeding the suggestion of the General Assembly of the United Nations, isinstantly prepared to meet privately with such other countries as may beåÒprincipally involved,åÓ to seek åÒan acceptable solutionåÓ to the atomicarmaments race which overshadows not only the peace, but the very life of theworld. We shall carry into these private or diplomatic talks a new conception.The UnitedStates would seek more than the mere reduction or elimination of atomicmaterials for military purposes. It is not enough to take this weapon out of thehands of the soldiers. It must be put into the hands of those who will know howto strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace.The UnitedStates knows that if the fearful trend of atomic military build-up can bereversed, this greatest of destructive forces can be developed into a greatboon, for the benefit of all mankind. The United States knows that peacefulpower from atomic energy is no dream of the future. That capability, alreadyproved, is here, now, today. Who can doubt, if the entire body of theworldåÕs scientists and engineers had adequate amounts of fissionable materialwith which to test and develop their ideas, that this capability would rapidly betransformed into universal, efficient, and economic usage?To hastenthe day when fear of the atom will begin to disappear from the minds of peopleand the governments of the East and West, there are certain steps that can betaken now. I therefore make the following proposals:Thegovernments principally involved, to the extent permitted by elementaryprudence, to begin now and continue to make joint contributions from theirstockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials to an InternationalAtomic Energy Agency. We would expect that such an agency would be set up underthe aegis of the United Nations. The ratios of contributions, the procedures, andother details would properly be within the scope of the åÒprivateconversationsåÓ I have referred to earlier.The United States is prepared to undertake these explorations in good faith. Any partner of the United States acting in the same good faith will find the United States a not unreasonable or ungenerous associate.Undoubtedly, initial and early contributions to this plan would be small in quantity. However, the proposal has the great virtue that it can be undertaken without the irritations and mutual suspicions incident to any attempt to set up a completely acceptable system of world-wide inspection and control.The AtomicEnergy Agency could be made responsible for the impounding, storage, andprotection of the contributed fissionable and other materials. The ingenuity ofour scientists will provide special, safe conditions under which such a bank offissionable material can be made essentially immune to surprise seizure.The moreimportant responsibility of this Atomic Energy Agency would be to devise methodswhereby this fissionable material would be allocated to serve the peacefulpursuits of mankind. Experts would be mobilized to apply atomic energy to theneeds of agriculture, medicine, and other peaceful activities. A special purposewould be to provide abundant electrical energy in the power-starved areas of theworld. Thus the contributing Powers would be dedicating some of their strength to serve the needs rather than the fears of mankind.The United States would be more than willing -- it would be proud to take up with others åÒprincipally involvedåÓ the development of plans whereby such peaceful use of atomic energy would be expedited.Of thoseåÒprincipally involvedåÓ the Soviet Union must, of course, be one. I would beprepared to submit to the Congress of the United States, and with everyexpectation of approval, any such plan that would, first, encourage world-wideinvestigation into the most effective peacetime uses of fissionable material,and with the certainty that they [the investigators] had all the material needed for the conduct of all experiments that were appropriate; second, begin to diminish the potential destructive power of the worldåÕs atomic stockpiles; third, allow all peoples of all nations to see that, in this enlightened age, the great Powers of the earth, both of the East and of the West, are interested in human aspirations first rather than in building up the armaments of war; fourth, open up a new channel for peaceful discussion and initiate at least a new approachto the many difficult problems that must be solved in both private and publicconversations, if the world is to shake off the inertia imposed by fear and is tomake positive progress toward peace.Againstthe dark background of the atomic bomb, the United States does not wish merelyto present strength, but also the desire and the hope for peace.The comingmonths will be fraught with fateful decisions. In this Assembly, in the capitalsand military headquarters of the world, in the hearts of men everywhere, be theygoverned or governors, may they be the decisions which will lead this world out offear and into peace.To the making of these fateful decisions, the United Statespledges before you, and therefore before the world, its determination to helpsolvethe fearful atomic dilemma --to devote its entire heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculousinventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to hislife.I againthank the delegates for the great honor they have done me in inviting me toappear before them and in listening me -- to me so courteously.Thank you.Book/CDs by Michael E.

(2)]President Anderson, members of the faculty, board of trustees, distinguishedguests, my old colleague, Senator Bob Byrd, who has earned his degree throughmany years of attending night law school, while I am earning mine in thenext 30 minutes, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: It is with great pride that I participate in this ceremony of the AmericanUniversity, sponsored by the Methodist Church, founded by Bishop John FletcherHurst, and first opened by President Woodrow Wilson in 1914. This is ayoung and growing university, but it has already fulfilled Bishop Hurst'senlightened hope for the study of history and public affairs in a citydevoted to the making of history and to the conduct of the public's business.By sponsoring this institution of higher learning for all who wish to learn,whatever their color or their creed, the Methodists of this area and theNation deserve the Nation's thanks, and I commend all those who are todaygraduating. Professor Woodrow Wilson once said that every man sent out from a universityshould be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time, and I am confidentthat the men and women who carry the honor of graduating from this institutionwill continue to give from their lives, from their talents, a high measureof public service and public support. ""There are few earthly things morebeautiful than a university,"" wrote John Masefield in his tribute to Englishuniversities -- and his words are equally true today. He did not referto towers or to campuses. He admired the splendid beauty of a university,because it was, he said, ""a place where those who hate ignorance may striveto know, where those who perceive truth may strive to make others see."" I have, therefore, chosen this time and place to discuss a topic onwhich ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived. Andthat is the most important topic on earth: peace. What kind of peace doI mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a Pax Americana enforcedon the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave orthe security of the slave. I am talking about genuine peace, the kind ofpeace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables menand nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for theirchildren -- not merely peace for Americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time. I speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war makes nosense in an age where great powers can maintain large and relatively invulnerablenuclear forces and refuse to surrender without resort to those forces.It makes no sense in an age where a single nuclear weapon contains almostten times the explosive force  delivered by all the allied air forces inthe Second World War. It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisonsproduced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soiland seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn. Today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on weapons acquiredfor the purpose of making sure we never need them is essential to the keepingof peace. But surely the acquisition of such idle stockpiles -- which canonly destroy and never create -- is not the only, much less the most efficient,means of assuring peace. I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary,rational end of rational men. I realize the pursuit of peace is notas dramatic as the pursuit of war, and frequently the words of the pursuersfall on deaf ears. But we have no more urgent task. Some say that it is useless to speak of peace or world law or worlddisarmament, and that it will be useless until the leaders of the SovietUnion adopt a more enlightened attitude. I hope they do. I believe we canhelp them do it. But I also believe that we must reexamine our own attitudes,as individuals and as a Nation, for our attitude is as essential as theirs.And every graduate of this school, every thoughtful citizen who despairsof war and wishes to bring peace, should begin by looking inward, by examininghis own attitude towards the possibilities of peace, towards the SovietUnion, towards the course of the cold war and towards freedom and peacehere at home. First examine our attitude towards peace itself. Too many of us thinkit is impossible. Too many think it is unreal. But that is a dangerous,defeatist belief. It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable, thatmankind is doomed, that we are gripped by forces we cannot control. Weneed not accept that view. Our problems are manmade; therefore, they canbe solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants. No problem of humandestiny is beyond human beings. Man's reason and spirit have often solvedthe seemingly unsolvable, and we believe they can do it again. I am notreferring to the absolute, infinite concept of universal peace and goodwill of which some fantasies and fanatics dream. I do not deny the valueof hopes and dreams but we merely invite discouragement and incredulityby making that our only and immediate goal. Let us focus instead on a more practical, more attainable peace, basednot on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution inhuman institutions -- on a series of concrete actions and effective agreementswhich are in the interest of all concerned. There is no single, simplekey to this peace; no grand or magic formula to be adopted by one or twopowers. Genuine peace must be the product of many nations, the sum of manyacts. It must be dynamic, not static, changing to meet the challenge ofeach new generation. For peace is a process -- a way of solving problems. With such a peace, there will still be quarrels and conflicting interests,as there are within families and nations. World peace, like community peace,does not require that each man love his neighbor, it requires only thatthey live together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes to ajust and peaceful settlement. And history teaches us that enmities betweennations, as between individuals, do not last forever. However fixed ourlikes and dislikes may seem, the tide of time and events will often bringsurprising changes in the relations between nations and neighbors. So letus persevere. Peace need not be impracticable, and war need not be inevitable.By defining our goal more clearly, by making it seem more manageable andless remote, we can help all people to see it, to draw hope from it, andto move irresistibly towards it. And second, let us reexamine our attitude towards the Soviet Union.It is discouraging to think that their leaders may actually believe whattheir propagandists write. It is discouraging to read a recent, authoritativeSoviet text on military strategy and find, on page after page, wholly baselessand incredible claims, such as the allegation that American imperialistcircles are preparing to unleash different types of war, that there isa very real threat of a preventive war being unleashed by American imperialistsagainst the Soviet Union, and that the political aims -- and I quote-- ""of the American imperialists are to enslave economically and politicallythe European and other capitalist countries and to achieve world dominationby means of aggressive war."" Truly, as it was written long ago: ""The wicked flee when no man pursueth.""Yet it is sad to read these Soviet statements, to realize the extentof the gulf between us. But it is also a warning, a warning to the Americanpeople not to fall into the same trap as the Soviets, not to see only adistorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict asinevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing morethan an exchange of threats. No government or social system is so evil that its people must be consideredas lacking in virtue. As Americans, we find communism profoundly repugnantas a negation of personal freedom and dignity. But we can still hail theRussian people for their many achievements in science and space, in economicand industrial growth, in culture, in acts of courage. Among the many traits the peoples of our two countries have in common,none is stronger than our mutual abhorrence of war. Almost unique amongthe major world powers, we have never been at war with each other. Andno nation in the history of battle ever suffered more than the Soviet Unionin the Second World War. At least 20 million lost their lives.Countless millions of homes and families were burned or sacked. A thirdof the nation's territory, including two thirds of its industrial base,was turned into a wasteland -- a loss equivalent to the destruction ofthis country east of Chicago. Today, should total war ever break out again -- no matter how -- ourtwo countries will be the primary target. It is an ironic but accuratefact that the two strongest powers are the two in the most danger of devastation.All we have built, all we have worked for, would be destroyed in the first24 hours. And even in the cold war, which brings burdens and dangers toso many countries, including this Nation's closest allies, our two countriesbear the heaviest burdens. For we are both devoting massive sums of moneyto weapons that could be better devoted to combat ignorance, poverty, anddisease. We are both caught up in a vicious and dangerous cycle, with suspicionon one side breeding suspicion on the other, and new weapons begetting counter-weapons.In short, both the United States and its allies, and the Soviet Union andits allies, have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace andin halting the arms race. Agreements to this end are in the interests ofthe Soviet Union as well as ours. And even the most hostile nations canbe relied upon to accept and keep those treaty obligations, and only thosetreaty obligations, which are in their own interest. So let us not be blind to our differences, but let us also direct attentionto our common interests and the means by which those differences can beresolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can helpmake the world safe for diversity. For in the final analysis, our mostbasic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathethe same air. We all cherish our children's futures. And we are all mortal.Third, let us reexamine our attitude towards the cold war, rememberingwe're not engaged in a debate, seeking to pile up debating points. We arenot here distributing blame or pointing the finger of judgment. We mustdeal with the world as it is, and not as it might have been had the historyof the last 18 years been different. We must, therefore, persevere in thesearch for peace in the hope that constructive changes within the Communistbloc might bring within reach solutions which now seem beyond us. We mustconduct our affairs in such a way that it becomes in the Communists' interestto agree on a genuine peace. And above all, while defending our own vitalinterests, nuclear powers must avert those confrontations which bring anadversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war.To adopt that kind of course in the nuclear age would be evidence onlyof the bankruptcy of our policy -- or of a collective death-wish for theworld. To secure these ends, America's weapons are nonprovocative, carefullycontrolled, designed to deter, and capable of selective use. Our militaryforces are committed to peace and disciplined in self-restraint. Our diplomatsare instructed to avoid unnecessary irritants and purely rhetorical hostility.For we can seek a relaxation of tensions without relaxing our guard. And,for our part, we do not need to use threats to prove we are resolute. Wedo not need to jam foreign broadcasts out of fear our faith will be eroded.We are unwilling to impose our system on any unwilling people, but we arewilling and able to engage in peaceful competition with any people on earth.Meanwhile, we seek to strengthen the United Nations, to help solve itsfinancial problems, to make it a more effective instrument for peace, todevelop it into a genuine world security system -- a system capable ofresolving disputes on the basis of law, of insuring the security of thelarge and the small, and of creating conditions under which arms can finallybe abolished. At the same time we seek to keep peace inside the non-Communistworld, where many nations, all of them our friends, are divided over issueswhich weaken Western unity, which invite Communist intervention, or whichthreaten to erupt into war. Our efforts in West New Guinea, in the Congo,in the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent, have been persistent andpatient despite criticism from both sides. We have also tried to set anexample for others, by seeking to adjust small but significant differenceswith our own closest neighbors in Mexico and Canada. Speaking of other nations, I wish to make one point clear. We are boundto many nations by alliances. Those alliances exist because our concernand theirs substantially overlap. Our commitment to defend Western Europeand West Berlin, for example, stands undiminished because of the identityof our vital interests. The United States will make no deal with the SovietUnion at the expense of other nations and other peoples, not merely becausethey are our partners, but also because their interests and ours converge.Our interests converge, however, not only in defending the frontiers offreedom, but in pursuing the paths of peace. It is our hope, and the purposeof allied policy, to convince the Soviet Union that she, too, should leteach nation choose its own future, so long as that choice does not interferewith the choices of others. The Communist drive to impose their politicaland economic system on others is the primary cause of world tension today.For there can be no doubt that if all nations could refrain from interferingin the self-determination of others, the peace would be much more assured.This will require a new effort to achieve world law, a new context forworld discussions. It will require increased understanding between theSoviets and ourselves. And increased understanding will require increasedcontact and communication. One step in this direction is the proposed arrangementfor a direct line between Moscow and Washington, to avoid on each sidethe dangerous delays, misunderstandings, and misreadings of others' actionswhich might occur at a time of crisis. We have also been talking in Geneva about our first-step measures ofarm[s] controls designed to limit the intensity of the arms race and reducethe risk of accidental war. Our primary long range interest in Geneva,however, is general and complete disarmament, designed to take place bystages, permitting parallel political developments to build the new institutionsof peace which would take the place of arms. The pursuit of disarmamenthas been an effort of this Government since the 1920's. It has been urgentlysought by the past three administrations. And however dim the prospectsare today, we intend to continue this effort -- to continue it in orderthat all countries, including our own, can better grasp what the problemsand possibilities of disarmament are. The only major area of these negotiations where the end is in sight,yet where a fresh start is badly needed, is in a treaty to outlaw nucleartests. The conclusion of such a treaty, so near and yet so far, would checkthe spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would placethe nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of thegreatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nucleararms. It would increase our security; it would decrease the prospects ofwar. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit,yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor thetemptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards. I'm taking this opportunity, therefore, to announce two important decisionsin this regard. First, Chairman Khrushchev, Prime Minister Macmillan, andI have agreed that high-level discussions will shortly begin in Moscowlooking towards early agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty. Ourhope must be tempered -- Our hopes must be tempered with the caution of history; but with our hopesgo the hopes of all mankind. Second, to make clear our good faith and solemnconvictions on this matter, I now declare that the United States does notpropose to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere so long as other statesdo not do so. We will not -- We will not be the first to resume. Such a declaration isno substitute for a formal binding treaty, but I hope it will help us achieveone. Nor would such a treaty be a substitute for disarmament, but I hopeit will help us achieve it. Finally, my fellow Americans, let us examine our attitude towards peaceand freedom here at home. The quality and spirit of our own society mustjustify and support our efforts abroad. We must show it in the dedicationof our own lives -- as many of you who are graduating today will have anopportunity to do, by serving without pay in the Peace Corps abroad orin the proposed National Service Corps here at home. But wherever we are,we must all, in our daily lives, live up to the age-old faith that peaceand freedom walk together. In too many of our cities today, the peace isnot secure because freedom is incomplete. It is the responsibility of theexecutive branch at all levels of government -- local, State, and National-- to provide and protect that freedom for all of our citizens by all meanswithin our authority. It is the responsibility of the legislative branchat all levels, wherever the authority is not now adequate, to make it adequate.And it is the responsibility of all citizens in all sections of this countryto respect the rights of others and respect the law of the land. All this -- All this is not unrelated to world peace. ""When a man's way[s] pleasethe Lord,"" the Scriptures tell us, ""He maketh even his enemies to be atpeace with him."" And is not peace, in the last analysis, basically a matterof human rights: the right to live out our lives without fear of devastation;the right to breathe air as nature provided it; the right of future generationsto a healthy existence? While we proceed to safeguard our national interests, let us also safeguardhuman interests. And the elimination of war and arms is clearly in theinterest of both. No treaty, however much it may be to the advantage ofall, however tightly it may be worded, can provide absolute security againstthe risks of deception and evasion. But it can, if it is sufficiently effectivein its enforcement, and it is sufficiently in the interests of its signers,offer far more security and far fewer risks than an unabated, uncontrolled,unpredictable arms race. The United States, as the world knows, will never start a war. We donot want a war. We do not now expect a war. This generation of Americanshas already had enough -- more than enough -- of war and hate and oppression.We shall be prepared if others wish it. We shall be alert to try tostop it. But we shall also do our part to build a world of peace wherethe weak are safe and the strong are just. We are not helpless before thattask or hopeless of its success. Confident and unafraid, we must laboron--not towards a strategy of annihilation but towards a strategy of peace.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,37," Ann Richards - Democratic National Convention Keynote AddressAnn RichardsDemocratic National Convention Keynote Address delivered 19 July 1988, Atlanta GAVideo Purchase  );  "", ""annrichards1988dnc."");   ; for flashThank you. Thank you. Thank you, very much.Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Buenas noches, mis amigos.I'm delighted to be here with you this evening, because after listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like.Twelve years ago Barbara Jordan, another Texas woman, Barbara made the keynote address to this convention, and two women in a hundred and sixty years is about par for the course.But if you give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels.I want to announce to this Nation that in a little more than 100 days, the Reagan -Meese - Deaver - Nofziger - Poindexter - North - Weinberger - Watt - Gorsuch -Lavelle - Stockman - Haig - Bork - Noriega - George Bush [era] will be over!You know, tonight I feel a little like I did when I played basketball in the 8th grade. I thought I looked real cute in my uniform. And then I heard a boy yell from the bleachers, Make that basket, bird legs. And my greatest fear is that same guy is somewhere out there in the audience tonight, and he's going to cut me down to size, because where I grew up there really wasnåÕt much tolerance for self-importance, people who put on airs.I was born during the Depression in a little community just outside Waco, and I grew up listening to Franklin Roosevelt on the radio. Well, it was back then that I came to understand the small truths and the hardships that bind neighbors together. Those were real people with real problems and they had real dreams about getting out of the Depression. I can remember summer nights when weåÕd put down what we called the Baptist pallet, and we listened to the grown-ups talk. I can still hear the sound of the dominoes clicking on the marble slab my daddy had found for a tabletop. I can still hear the laughter of the men telling jokes you werenåÕt supposed to hear -- talkin' about how big that old buck deer was, laughin' about mama puttin' Clorox in the well when the frog fell in.They talked about war and Washington and what this country needed.They talked straight talk.And it came from people who were living their lives as best they could. And thatåÕs what weåÕre gonna do tonight. WeåÕre gonna tell how the cow ate the cabbage.I got a letter last week from a young mother in Lorena, Texas, and I wanna read part of it to you.She writes,åÒOur worries go from pay day to pay day, just like millions of others.And we have two fairly decent incomes, but I worry how IåÕm going to pay the rising car insurance and food.I pray my kids donåÕt have a growth spurt from August to December, so I donåÕt have to buy new jeans.We buy clothes at the budget stores and we have them fray and fade and stretch in the first wash.We ponder and try to figure out how we're gonna pay for college and braces and tennis shoes.We donåÕt take vacations and we don't go out to eat.Please donåÕt think me ungrateful.We have jobs and a nice place to live, and weåÕre healthy.We're the people you see every day in the grocery stores, and we obey the laws. We pay our taxes. We fly our flags on holidays and we plod along trying to make it better for ourselves and our children and our parents.We arenåÕt vocal any more. I think maybe weåÕre too tired. I believe that people like us are forgotten in America.åÓWell of course you believe you're forgotten, because you have been.This Republican Administration treats us as if we were pieces of a puzzle that canåÕt fit together. They've tried to put us into compartments and separate us from each other.Their political theory is åÒdivide and conquer.åÓ TheyåÕve suggested time and time again that what is of interest to one group of Americans is not of interest to any one else.WeåÕve been isolated. WeåÕve been lumped into that sad phraseology called åÒspecial interests.åÓ TheyåÕve told farmers that they were selfish, that they would drive up food prices if they asked the government to intervene on behalf of the family farm, and we watched farms go on the auction block while we bought food from foreign countries. Well, thatåÕs wrong!They told working mothers itåÕs all their fault -- their families are falling apart because they had to go to work to keep their kids in jeans and tennis shoes and college.And theyåÕre wrong!! They told American labor they were trying to ruin free enterprise by asking for 60 daysåÕ notice of plant closings, and thatåÕs wrong. And they told the auto industry and the steel industry and the timber industry and the oil industry, companies being threatened by foreign products flooding this country, that youåÕre protectionist if you think the government should enforce our trade laws. And that is wrong. When they belittle us for demanding clean air and clean water for trying to save the oceans and the ozone layer, thatåÕs wrong.No wonder we feel isolated and confused. We want answers and their answer is that something is wrong with you. Well nothing's wrong with you.NothingåÕs wrong with you that you canåÕt fix in November!We've been told -- We've been told that the interests of the South and the Southwest are not the same interests as the North and the Northeast.They pit one group against the other.They've divided this country and in our isolation we think government isnåÕt gonna help us, and we're alone in our feelings.We feel forgotten. Well, the fact is that we are not an isolated piece of their puzzle.We are one nation. We are the United States of America.Now we Democrats believe that America is still the county of fair play, that we can come out of a small town or a poor neighborhood and have the same chance as anyone else; and it doesnåÕt matter whether we are black or Hispanic or disabled or a women [sic].We believe that America is a country where small business owners must succeed, because they are the bedrock, backbone of our economy.We believe that our kids deserve good daycare and public schools. We believe our kids deserve public schools where students can learn and teachers can teach.And we wanna believe that our parents will have a good retirement and that we will too.We Democrats believe that social security is a pact that can not be broken.We wanna believe that we can live out our lives without the terrible fear that an illness is going to bankrupt us and our children. We Democrats believe that America can overcome any problem, including the dreaded disease called AIDS. We believe that America is still a country where there is more to life than just a constant struggle for money.And we believe that America must have leaders who show us that our struggles amount to something and contribute to something larger -- leaders who want us to be all that we can be.We want leaders like Jesse Jackson. Jesse Jackson is a leader and a teacher who can open our hearts and open our minds and stir our very souls. And he has taught us that we are as good as our capacity for caring, caring about the drug problem, caring about crime, caring about education, and caring about each other.Now, in contrast, the greatest nation of the free world has had a leader for eight straight years that has pretended that he can not hear our questions over the noise of the helicopters. And we know he doesnåÕt wanna answer. But we have a lot of questions. And when we get our questions asked, or there is a leak, or an investigation the only answer we get is, I donåÕt know, or I forgot.But you wouldnåÕt accept that answer from your children.I wouldn't. DonåÕt tell me you 'donåÕt know' or you 'forgot.' We're not going to have the America that we want until we elect leaders who are gonna tell the truth; not most days but every day; leaders who donåÕt forget what they donåÕt want to remember. And for eight straight years George Bush hasn't displayed the slightest interest in anything we care about.And now that he's after a job that he canåÕt get appointed to, he's like Columbus discovering America. He's found child care.He's found education.Poor George.He canåÕt help it.He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.Well, no wonder. No wonder we canåÕt figure it out. Because the leadership of this nation is telling us one thing on TV and doing something entirely different.They tell us -- They tell us that they're fighting a war against terrorists. And then we find out that the White House is selling arms to the Ayatollah. They -- They tell us that theyåÕre fighting a war on drugs and then people come on TV and testify that the CIAand the DEA and the FBI knew they were flying drugs into America all along.And theyåÕre negotiating with a dictator who is shoveling cocaine into this country like crazy.I guess thatåÕs their Central American strategy.Now they tell us that employment rates are great, and that theyåÕre for equal opportunity. But we know it takes two paychecks to make ends meet today, when it used to take one.And the opportunity theyåÕre so proud of is low-wage, dead-end jobs.And there is no major city in America where you cannot see homeless men sitting in parking lots holding signs that say, åÒI will work for food.åÓNow my friends, we really are at a crucial point in American history. Under this Administration we have devoted our resources into making this country a military colossus. But weåÕve let our economic lines of defense fall into disrepair.The debt of this nation is greater than it has ever been in our history.We fought a world war on less debt than the Republicans have built up in the last eight years.You know, itåÕs kind of like that brother-in-law who drives a flashy new car, but heåÕs always borrowing money from you to make the payments.Well, but letåÕs take what they are most proudest of --that is their stand of defense.We Democrats are committed to a strong America, and, quite frankly, when our leaders say to us, We need a new weapons system, our inclination is to say, åÒWell, they must be right.åÓ But when we pay billions for planes that wonåÕt fly, billions for tanks that wonåÕt fire, and billions for systems that wonåÕt work, that old dog wonåÕt hunt. And you donåÕt have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesnåÕt make America strong, that itåÕs a bum deal.Now IåÕm going to tell you, I'm really glad that our young people missed the Depression and missed the great Big War. But I do regret that they missed the leaders that I knew, leaders who told us when things were tough, and that weåÕd have to sacrifice, and that these difficulties might last for a while.They didnåÕt tell us things were hard for us because we were different, or isolated, or special interests.They brought us together and they gave us a sense of national purpose. They gave us Social Security and they told us they were setting up a system where we could pay our own money in, and when the time came for our retirement we could take the money out.People in the rural areas were told that we deserved to have electric lights, and they were gonna harness the energy that was necessary to give us electricity so my grandmamma didnåÕt have to carry that old coal oil lamp around. And they told us that they were gonna guarant[ee] when we put our money in the bank, that the money was going to be there, and it was going to be insured. They did not lie to us.And I think one of the saving graces of Democrats is that we are candid. We talk straight talk.We tell people what we think.And that tradition and those values live today in Michael Dukakis from Massachusetts.Michael Dukakis knows that this country is on the edge of a great new era, that weåÕre not afraid of change, that weåÕre for thoughtful, truthful, strong leadership.Behind his calm thereåÕs an impatience to unify this country and to get on with the future.His instincts are deeply American.TheyåÕre tough and theyåÕre generous. And personally, I have to tell you that I have never met a man who had a more remarkable sense about what is really important in life.And then thereåÕs my friend and my teacher for many years, Senator Lloyd Bentsen. And I couldnåÕt be prouder, both as a Texan and as a Democrat, because Lloyd Bentsen understands America. From the barrio to the boardroom, he knows how to bring us together, by regions, by economics, and by example.And heåÕs already beaten George Bush once.So, when it comes right down to it, this election is a contest between those who are satisfied with what they have and those who know we can do better.ThatåÕs what this election is really all about. ItåÕs about the American dream -- those who want to keep it for the few and those who know it must be nurtured and passed along.IåÕm a grandmother now. And I have one nearly perfect granddaughter named Lily. And when I hold that grandbaby, I feel the continuity of life that unites us, that binds generation to generation, that ties us with each other.And sometimes I spread that Baptist pallet out on the floor, and Lily and I roll a ball back and forth.And I think of all the families like mine, like the one in Lorena, Texas, like the ones that nurture children all across America.And as I look at Lily, I know that it is within families that we learn both the need to respect individual human dignity and to work together for our common good. Within our families, within our nation, it is the same.And as I sit there, I wonder if sheåÕll ever grasp the changes IåÕve seen in my life -- if sheåÕll ever believe that there was a time when blacks could not drink from public water fountains, when Hispanic children were punished for speaking Spanish in the public schools, and women couldnåÕt vote.I think of all the political fights IåÕve fought, and all the compromises IåÕve had to accept as part payment. And I think of all the small victories that have added up to national triumphs and all the things that would never have happened and all the people who wouldåÕve been left behind if we had not reasoned and fought and won those battles together. And I will tell Lily that those triumphs were Democratic Party triumphs.I want so much to tell Lily how far weåÕve come, you and I.And as the ball rolls back and forth, I want to tell her how very lucky she is that for all our difference, we are still the greatest nation on this good earth. And our strength lies in the men and women who go to work every day, who struggle to balance their family and their jobs, and who should never, ever be forgotten.I just hope that like her grandparents and her great-grandparents before that Lily goes on to raise her kids with the promise that echoes in homes all across America: that we can do better, and thatåÕs what this election is all about.Thank you very much.Book/CDs by Michael E.

NixonResignation Address to the Nation   delivered 8 August 1974Video Purchase  );  "", ""rnixonresignationspeechtwt9gf9."");   ; for flash[  fromaudio.]Good evening: This is the 37th time I have spoken to you from this office, where somany decisions have been made that shape the history of this nation. Eachtime I have done so to discuss with you some matter that I believe affectedthe national interest. In all the decisions I have made in my public lifeI have always tried to do what was best for the nation.Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt itwas my duty to persevere -- to make every possible effort to complete theterm of office to which you elected me. In the past few days, however,it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough politicalbase in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as therewas such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutionalprocess through to its conclusion; that to do otherwise would be unfaithfulto the spirit of that deliberately difficult process, and a dangerouslydestabilizing precedent for the future. But with the disappearance of thatbase, I now believe that the constitutional purpose has been served. Andthere is no longer a need for the process to be prolonged.I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personalagony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to doso. But the interests of the nation must always come before any personalconsiderations. From the discussions I have had with Congressional andother leaders I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I mightnot have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary toback the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this officein the way the interests of the nation will require.I have never been a quitter.To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinctin my body. But as President, I must put the interests of America first.America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularlyat this time with problems we face at home and abroad. To continue to fightthrough the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totallyabsorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress ina period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroadand prosperity without inflation at home.Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow.Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in thisoffice.As I recall the high hopes for America with which we began this secondterm, I feel a great sadness that I will not be here in this office workingon your behalf to achieve those hopes in the next two and a half years.But in turning over direction of the Government to Vice President FordI know, as I told the nation when I nominated him for that office ten monthsago, that the leadership of America would be in good hands.In passing this office to the Vice President, I also do so with theprofound sense of the weight of responsibility that will fall on his shoulderstomorrow, and therefore of the understanding, the patience, the cooperationhe will need from all Americans. As he assumes that responsibility he willdeserve the help and the support of all of us. As we look to the future,the first essential is to begin healing the wounds of this nation. To putthe bitterness and divisions of the recent past behind us and to rediscoverthose shared ideals that lie at the heart of our strength and unity asa great and as a free people.By taking this action, I hope that I will have hastened the start ofthat process of healing which is so desperately needed in America. I regretdeeply any injuries that may have been done in the course of the eventsthat led to this decision. I would say only that if some of my judgmentswere wrong -- and some were wrong -- they were made in what I believedat the time to be the best interests of the nation.To those who have stood with me during these past difficult months,to my family, my friends, the many others who joined in supporting my causebecause they believed it was right, I will be eternally grateful for yoursupport. And to those who have not felt able to give me your support, letme say I leave with no bitterness toward those who have opposed me, becauseall of us in the final analysis have been concerned with the good of thecountry, however our judgments might differ.So let us all now join together in affirming that common commitmentand in helping our new President succeed for the benefit of all Americans.I shall leave this office with regret at not completing my term but withgratitude for the privilege of serving as your President for the past fiveand a half years. These years have been a momentous time in the historyof our nation and the world. They have been a time of achievement in whichwe can all be proud, achievements that represent the shared efforts ofthe administration, the Congress and the people. But the challenges aheadare equally great. And they, too, will require the support and the effortsof the Congress and the people, working in cooperation with the new Administration.We have ended America's longest war. But in the work of securing a lastingpeace in the world, the goals ahead are even more far-reaching and moredifficult. We must complete a structure of peace, so that it will be saidof this generation -- our generation of Americans -- by the people of allnations, not only that we ended one war but that we prevented future wars.We have unlocked the doors that for a quarter of a century stood betweenthe United States and the People's Republic of China. We must now insurethat the one-quarter of the world's people who live in the People's Republicof China will be and remain, not our enemies, but our friends.In the Middle East, 100 million people in the Arab countries, many ofwhom have considered us their enemy for nearly 20 years, now look on usas their friends. We must continue to build on that friendship so thatpeace can settle at last over the Middle East and so that the cradle ofcivilization will not become its grave. Together with the Soviet Unionwe have made the crucial breakthroughs that have begun the process of limitingnuclear arms. But, we must set as our goal, not just limiting, but reducingand finally destroying these terrible weapons, so that they cannot destroycivilization. And so that the threat of nuclear war will no longer hangover the world and the people. We have opened a new relation with the SovietUnion. We must continue to develop and expand that new relationship,so that the two strongest nations of the world will live together in cooperationrather than confrontation.Around the world -- in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America, in the MiddleEast -- there are millions of people who live in terrible poverty, evenstarvation. We must keep as our goal turning away from production for warand expanding production for peace so that people everywhere on this earthcan at last look forward, in their children's time, if not in our own time,to having the necessities for a decent life. Here, in America, we are fortunatethat most of our people have not only the blessings of liberty but alsothe means to live full and good, and by the world's standards even abundantlives.We must press on, however, toward a goal not only of more and betterjobs but of full opportunity for every American, and of what we are strivingso hard right now to achieve -- prosperity without inflation.For more than a quarter of a century in public life, I have shared inthe turbulent history of this evening. I have fought for what I believein. I have tried, to the best of my ability, to discharge those dutiesand meet those responsibilities that were entrusted to me. Sometimes Ihave succeeded. And sometimes I have failed. But always I have taken heartfrom what Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the arena, whoseface is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, whoerrs and comes short again and again because there is not effort withouterror and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deed, whoknows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself ina worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievementsand with the worst if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.I pledge to you tonight that as long as I have a breath of life in mybody, I shall continue in that spirit. I shall continue to work for thegreat causes to which I have been dedicated throughout my years as a Congressman,a Senator, Vice President and President, the cause of peace -- not justfor America but among all nations -- prosperity, justice and opportunityfor all of our people.There is one cause above all to which I have been devoted and to whichI shall always be devoted for as long as I live.When I first took the oath of office as President five and a half yearsago, I made this sacred commitment: to consecrate my office, my energies,and all the wisdom I can summon to the cause of peace among nations. I'vedone my very best in all the days since to be true to that pledge. As aresult of these efforts, I am confident that the world is a safer placetoday, not only for the people of America but for the people of all nations,and that all of our children have a better chance than before of livingin peace rather than dying in war.This, more than anything, is what I hoped to achieve when I sought thePresidency.This, more than anything, is what I hope will be my legacy to you, toour country, as I leave the Presidency.To have served in this office is to have felt a very personal senseof kinship with each and every American.In leaving it, I do so with this prayer: May God's grace be with youin all the days ahead.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,39," Woodrow Wilson -- The Fourteen PointsWoodrow WilsonThe Fourteen Points delivered 8 January 1918 for flashIt will be our wish and purpose that the processes of peace, when they are begun, shall be absolutely open and that they shall involve and permit henceforth no secret understandings of any kind. The day of conquest and aggrandizement is gone by; so is also the day of secret covenants entered into in the interest of particular governments and likely at some unlooked-for moment to upset the peace of the world. It is this happy fact, now clear to the view of every public man whose thoughts do not still linger in an age that is dead and gone, which makes it possible for every nation whose purposes are consistent with justice and the peace of the world to avow nor or at any other time the objects it has in view. We entered this war because violations of right had occurred which touched us to the quick and made the life of our own people impossible unless they were corrected and the world secure once for all against their recurrence. What we demand in this war, therefore, is nothing peculiar to ourselves. It is that the world be made fit and safe to live in; and particularly that it be made safe for every peace-loving nation which, like our own, wishes to live its own life, determine its own institutions, be assured of justice and fair dealing by the other peoples of the world as against force and selfish aggression. All the peoples of the world are in effect partners in this interest, and for our own part we see very clearly that unless justice be done to others it will not be done to us. The program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program; and that program, the only possible program, as we see it, is this: I. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private international understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view. II. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants. III. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance. IV. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety. V. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined. VI. The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political development and national policy and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the months to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy. VII. Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and restored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations. No other single act will serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws which they have themselves set and determined for the government of their relations with one another. Without this healing act the whole structure and validity of international law is forever impaired. VIII. All French territory should be freed and the invaded portions restored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more be made secure in the interest of all. IX. A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality. X. The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest opportunity to autonomous development. XI. Rumania, Serbia, and Montenegro should be evacuated; occupied territories restored; Serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea; and the relations of the several Balkan states to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality; and international guarantees of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity of the several Balkan states should be entered into. XII. The Turkish portion of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development, and the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees. XIII. An independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant. XIV. A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike. In regard to these essential rectifications of wrong and assertions of right we feel ourselves to be intimate partners of all the governments and peoples associated together against the Imperialists. We cannot be separated in interest or divided in purpose. We stand together until the end. For such arrangements and covenants we are willing to fight and to continue to fight until they are achieved; but only because we wish the right to prevail and desire a just and stable peace such as can be secured only by removing the chief provocations to war, which this program does remove. We have no jealousy of German greatness, and there is nothing in this program that impairs it. We grudge her no achievement or distinction of learning or of pacific enterprise such as have made her record very bright an d very enviable. We do not wish to injure her or to block in any way her legitimate influence or power. We do not wish to fight her either with arms or with hostile arrangements of trade if she is willing to associate herself with us and the other peace-loving nations of the world in covenants of justice and law and fair dealing. We wish her only to accept a place of equality among the peoples of the world -- the new world in which we now live -- instead of a place of mastery.

Roosevelt -- The Four Freedoms  Franklin Delano RooseveltThe Four Freedoms delivered 6 January, 1941 (photo of FDR in 1936)  Audio  Address  );  "", ""fdrfourfreedoms."");   ; for flash[ Text version   below transcribed directly from audio.]  Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the 77th Congress:I address you, the members of this new Congress, at a moment unprecedented in the history of the union. I use the word åÒunprecedentedåÓ because at no previous time has American security been as seriously threatened from without as it is today.Since the permanent formation of our government under the Constitution in 1789, most of the periods of crisis in our history have related to our domestic affairs. And, fortunately, only one of these -- the four-year war between the States -- ever threatened our national unity.Today, thank God, 130,000,000 Americans in 48 States have forgotten points of the compass in our national unity.It is true that prior to 1914 the United States often has been disturbed by events in other continents. We have even engaged in two wars with European nations and in a number of undeclared wars in the West Indies, in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific, for the maintenance of American rights and for the principles of peaceful commerce. But in no case had a serious threat been raised against our national safety or our continued independence.What I seek to convey is the historic truth that the United States as a nation has at all times maintained opposition -- clear, definite opposition -- to any attempt to lock us in behind an ancient Chinese wall while the procession of civilization went past.Today, thinking of our children and of their children, we oppose enforced isolation for ourselves or for any other part of the Americas.That determination of ours, extending over all these years, was proved, for example, in the early days during the quarter century of wars following the French Revolution. While the Napoleonic struggles did threaten interests of the United States because of the French foothold in the West Indies and in Louisiana, and while we engaged in the War of 1812 to vindicate our right to peaceful trade, it is nevertheless clear that neither France nor Great Britain nor any other nation was aiming at domination of the whole world.And in like fashion, from 1815 to 1914 -- ninety-nine years -- no single war in Europe or in Asia constituted a real threat against our future or against the future of any other American nation.Except in the Maximilian interlude in Mexico, no foreign power sought to establish itself in this hemisphere.And the strength of the British fleet in the Atlantic has been a friendly strength; it is still a friendly strength.Even when the World War broke out in 1914, it seemed to contain only small threat of danger to our own American future. But as time went on, as we remember, the American people began to visualize what the downfall of democratic nations might mean to our own democracy.We need not overemphasize imperfections in the peace of Versailles.We need not harp on failure of the democracies to deal with problems of world reconstruction.We should remember that the peace of 1919 was far less unjust than the kind of pacification which began even before Munich, and which is being carried on under the new order of tyranny that seeks to spread over every continent today. The American people have unalterably set their faces against that tyranny.I suppose that every realist knows that the democratic way of life is at this moment being directly assailed in every part of the world -- assailed either by arms or by secret spreading of poisonous propaganda by those who seek to destroy unity and promote discord in nations that are still at peace. During 16 long months this assault has blotted out the whole pattern of democratic life in an appalling number of independent nations, great and small. And the assailants are still on the march, threatening other nations, great and small.Therefore, as your President, performing my constitutional duty to give to the Congress information of the state of the union, I find it unhappily necessary to report that the future and the safety of our country and of our democracy are overwhelmingly involved in events far beyond our borders.Armed defense of democratic existence is now being gallantly waged in four continents. If that defense fails, all the population and all the resources of Europe and Asia, and Africa and Austral-Asia will be dominated by conquerors. And let us remember that the total of those populations in those four continents, the total of those populations and their resources greatly exceed the sum total of the population and the resources of the whole of the Western Hemisphere -- yes, many times over.In times like these it is immature -- and, incidentally, untrue -- for anybody to brag that an unprepared America, single-handed and with one hand tied behind its back, can hold off the whole world.No realistic American can expect from a dictatoråÕs peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion -- or even good business.Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors.Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.As a nation we may take pride in the fact that we are soft-hearted; but we cannot afford to be soft-headed. We must always be wary of those who with sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal preach the ism of appeasement. We must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests.I have recently pointed out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into our very midst the physical attack which we must eventually expect if the dictator nations win this war.There is much loose talk of our immunity from immediate and direct invasion from across the seas. Obviously, as long as the British Navy retains its power, no such danger exists. Even if there were no British Navy, it is not probable that any enemy would be stupid enough to attack us by landing troops in the United States from across thousands of miles of ocean, until it had acquired strategic bases from which to operate.But we learn much from the lessons of the past years in Europe -- particularly the lesson of Norway, whose essential seaports were captured by treachery and surprise built up over a series of years. The first phase of the invasion of this hemisphere would not be the landing of regular troops. The necessary strategic points would be occupied by secret agents and by their dupes -- and great numbers of them are already here and in Latin America. As long as the aggressor nations maintain the offensive they, not we, will choose the time and the place and the method of their attack.And that is why the future of all the American Republics is today in serious danger. That is why this annual message to the Congress is unique in our history. That is why every member of the executive branch of the government and every member of the Congress face great responsibility, great accountability. The need of the moment is that our actions and our policy should be devoted primarily -- almost exclusively -- to meeting this foreign peril.For all our domestic problems are now a part of the great emergency.Just as our national policy in internal affairs has been based upon a decent respect for the rights and the dignity of all our fellow men within our gates, so our national policy in foreign affairs has been based on a decent respect for the rights and the dignity of all nations, large and small.And the justice of morality must and will win in the end.Our national policy is this:First, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to all-inclusive national defense.Secondly, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to full support of all those resolute people everywhere who are resisting aggression and are thereby keeping war away from our hemisphere.By this support we express our determination that the democratic cause shall prevail, and we strengthen the defense and the security of our own nation.Third, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to the proposition that principles of morality and considerations for our own security will never permit us to acquiesce in a peace dictated by aggressors and sponsored by appeasers.We know that enduring peace cannot be bought at the cost of other people's freedom.In the recent national election there was no substantial difference between the two great parties in respect to that national policy.No issue was fought out on this line before the American electorate.And today it is abundantly evident that American citizens everywhere are demanding and supporting speedy and complete action in recognition of obvious danger.Therefore, the immediate need is a swift and driving increase in our armament production. Leaders of industry and labor have responded to our summons.Goals of speed have been set.In some cases these goals are being reached ahead of time.In some cases we are on schedule; in other cases there are slight but not serious delays.And in some cases -- and, I am sorry to say, very important cases -- we are all concerned by the slowness of the accomplishment of our plans.The Army and Navy, however, have made substantial progress during the past year.Actual experience is improving and speeding up our methods of production with every passing day.And today's best is not good enough for tomorrow.I am not satisfied with the progress thus far made.The men in charge of the program represent the best in training, in ability, and in patriotism.They are not satisfied with the progress thus far made. None of us will be satisfied until the job is done.No matter whether the original goal was set too high or too low, our objective is quicker and better results.To give you two illustrations:We are behind schedule in turning out finished airplanes. We are working day and night to solve the innumerable problems and to catch up.We are ahead of schedule in building warships, but we are working to get even further ahead of that schedule.To change a whole nation from a basis of peacetime production of implements of peace to a basis of wartime production of implements of war is no small task.And the greatest difficulty comes at the beginning of the program, when new tools, new plant facilities, new assembly lines, new shipways must first be constructed before the actual material begins to flow steadily and speedily from them.The Congress of course, must rightly keep itself informed at all times of the progress of the program. However, there is certain information, as the Congress itself will readily recognize, which, in the interests of our own security and those of the nations that we are supporting, must of needs be kept in confidence.New circumstances are constantly begetting new needs for our safety.I shall ask this Congress for greatly increased new appropriations and authorizations to carry on what we have begun.I also ask this Congress for authority and for funds sufficient to manufacture additional munitions and war supplies of many kinds, to be turned over to those nations which are now in actual war with aggressor nations.Our most useful and immediate role is to act as an arsenal for them as well as for ourselves.They do not need manpower, but they do need billions of dollarsåÕ worth of the weapons of defense.The time is near when they will not be able to pay for them all in ready cash. We cannot, and we will not, tell them that they must surrender merely because of present inability to pay for the weapons which we know they must have.I do not recommend that we make them a loan of dollars with which to pay for these weapons -- a loan to be repaid in dollars.I recommend that we make it possible for those nations to continue to obtain war materials in the United States, fitting their orders into our own program.And nearly all of their material would, if the time ever came, be useful in our own defense.Taking counsel of expert military and naval authorities, considering what is best for our own security, we are free to decide how much should be kept here and how much should be sent abroad to our friends who, by their determined and heroic resistance, are giving us time in which to make ready our own defense.For what we send abroad we shall be repaid, repaid within a reasonable time following the close of hostilities, repaid in similar materials, or at our option in other goods of many kinds which they can produce and which we need.Let us say to the democracies: We Americans are vitally concerned in your defense of freedom.We are putting forth our energies, our resources, and our organizing powers to give you the strength to regain and maintain a free world.We shall send you in ever-increasing numbers, ships, planes, tanks, guns.That is our purpose and our pledge.In fulfillment of this purpose we will not be intimidated by the threats of dictators that they will regard as a breach of international law or as an act of war our aid to the democracies which dare to resist their aggression.Such aid -- Such aid is not an act of war, even if a dictator should unilaterally proclaim it so to be.And when the dictators -- if the dictators -- are ready to make war upon us, they will not wait for an act of war on our part.They did not wait for Norway or Belgium or the Netherlands to commit an act of war.Their only interest is in a new one-way international law, which lacks mutuality in its observance and therefore becomes an instrument of oppression.The happiness of future generations of Americans may well depend on how effective and how immediate we can make our aid felt.No one can tell the exact character of the emergency situations that we may be called upon to meet.The nation's hands must not be tied when the nation's life is in danger.Yes, and we must prepare, all of us prepare, to make the sacrifices that the emergency -- almost as serious as war itself -- demands.Whatever stands in the way of speed and efficiency in defense, in defense preparations of any kind, must give way to the national need.A free nation has the right to expect full cooperation from all groups.A free nation has the right to look to the leaders of business, of labor, and of agriculture to take the lead in stimulating effort, not among other groups but within their own group.The best way of dealing with the few slackers or trouble-makers in our midst is, first, to shame them by patriotic example, and if that fails, to use the sovereignty of government to save government.As men do not live by bread alone, they do not fight by armaments alone.Those who man our defenses and those behind them who build our defenses must have the stamina and the courage which come from  unshakable belief in the manner of life which they are defending.The mighty action that we are calling for cannot be based on a disregard of all the things worth fighting for.The nation takes great satisfaction and much strength from the things which have been done to make its people conscious of their individual stake in the preservation of democratic life in America. Those things have toughened the fiber of our people, have renewed their faith and strengthened their devotion to the institutions we make ready to protect.Certainly this is no time for any of us to stop thinking about the social and economic problems which are the root cause of the social revolution which is today a supreme factor in the world.For there is nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and strong democracy.The basic things expected by our people of their political and economic systems are simple.They are:Equality of opportunity for youth and for others.Jobs for those who can work.Security for those who need it.The ending of special privilege for the few.The preservation of civil liberties for all.The enjoyment -- The enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living.These are the simple, the basic things that must never be lost sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable complexity of our modern world.The inner and abiding strength of our economic and political systems is dependent upon the degree to which they fulfill these expectations.Many subjects connected with our social economy call for immediate improvement.As examples:We should bring more citizens under the coverage of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance.We should widen the opportunities for adequate medical care.We should plan a better system by which persons deserving or needing gainful employment may obtain it.I have called for personal sacrifice, and I am assured of the willingness of almost all Americans to respond to that call.A part of the sacrifice means the payment of more money in taxes.In my budget message I will recommend that a greater portion of this great defense program be paid for from taxation than we are paying for today.No person should try, or be allowed to get rich out of the program, and the principle of tax payments in accordance with ability to pay should be constantly before our eyes to guide our legislation.If the Congress maintains these principles the voters, putting patriotism ahead pocketbooks, will give you their applause.In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.The first is freedom of speech and expression -- everywhere in the world.The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way -- everywhere in the world.The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants -- everywhere in the world.The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor -- anywhere in the world.That is no vision of a distant millennium.It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation.That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called åÒnew orderåÓ of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb.To that new order we oppose the greater conception -- the moral order.A good society is able to face schemes of world domination and foreign revolutions alike without fear.Since the beginning of our American history we have been engaged in change, in a perpetual, peaceful revolution, a revolution which goes on steadily, quietly, adjusting itself to changing conditions without the concentration camp or the quicklime in the ditch.The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries, working together in a friendly, civilized society.This nation has placed its destiny in the hands and heads and hearts of its millions of free men and women, and its faith in freedom under the guidance of God.Freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere.Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights and keep them.Our strength is our unity of purpose.To that high concept there can be no end save victory.Book/CDs by Michael E.

(2)]Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:I need not pause to say how very delighted I am to be here tonight, and how very delighted I am to see you expressing your concern about the issues that will be discussed tonight by turning out in such large numbers. I also want to say that I consider it a great honor to share this program with Dr. Bennett, Dr. Commager, and Rabbi Heschel, and some of the distinguished leaders and personalities of our nation. And of course itåÕs always good to come back to Riverside church. Over the last eight years, I have had the privilege of preaching here almost every year in that period, and it is always a rich and rewarding experience to come to this great church and this great pulpit.I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice. Ijoin you in this meeting because I'm in deepest agreement with the aims and work ofthe organization which has brought us together: Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam.The recent statements of your executive committee are the sentiments of my own heart, and Ifound myself in full accord when I read its opening lines: A time comes when silenceis betrayal. And that time has come for us in relation to Vietnam.The truth of these words is beyond doubt, but the mission to which they call us is amost difficult one. Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easilyassume the task of opposing their government's policy, especially in time of war. Nor doesthe human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformistthought within one's own bosom and in the surrounding world. Moreover, when the issues athand seem as perplexing as they often do in the case of this dreadful conflict, we arealways on the verge of being mesmerized by uncertainty; but we must move on.And some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found that thecalling to speak is often a vocation of agony, but we must speak. We must speak with allthe humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak. And we mustrejoice as well, for surely this is the first time in our nation's history that asignificant number of its religious leaders have chosen to move beyond the prophesying ofsmooth patriotism to the high grounds of a firm dissent based upon the mandates ofconscience and the reading of history. Perhaps a new spirit is rising among us. If it is,let us trace its movements and pray that our own inner being may be sensitive to itsguidance, for we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the darkness that seems so closearound us.Over the past two years, as I have moved to break the betrayal of my own silences andto speak from the burnings of my own heart, as I have called for radical departures fromthe destruction of Vietnam, many persons have questioned me about the wisdom of my path.At the heart of their concerns this query has often loomed large and loud: Why are youspeaking about the war, Dr. King? Why are you joining the voices of dissent? Peace and civilrights don't mix, they say. Aren't you hurting the cause of your people, they ask? Andwhen I hear them, though I often understand the source of their concern, I am neverthelessgreatly saddened, for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me, mycommitment or my calling. Indeed, their questions suggest that they do not know the worldin which they live.In the light of such tragic misunderstanding, I deem it of signal importance to try tostate clearly, and I trust concisely, why I believe that the path from Dexter AvenueBaptist Church -- the church in Montgomery, Alabama, where I began my pastorate -- leadsclearly to this sanctuary tonight.I come to this platform tonight to make a passionate plea to my beloved nation. Thisspeech is not addressed to Hanoi or to the National Liberation Front. It is not addressedto China or to Russia. Nor is it an attempt to overlook the ambiguity of the total situation and the need fora collective solution to the tragedy of Vietnam. Neither is it an attempt to make NorthVietnam or the National Liberation Front paragons of virtue, nor to overlook the role theymust play in the successful resolution of the problem. While they both may have justifiablereasons to be suspicious of the good faith of the United States, life and history giveeloquent testimony to the fact that conflicts are never resolved without trustful give andtake on both sides.Tonight, however, I wish not to speak with Hanoi and the National Liberation Front, but rather to my fellow Americans.Since I am a preacher by calling, I suppose it isnot surprising that I have seven major reasons for bringing Vietnam into the field of my moral vision. There is at the outset avery obvious and almost facile connection between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I,and others, have been waging in America. A few years ago there was a shining moment inthat struggle. It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor -- both blackand white -- through the poverty program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings.Then came the buildup in Vietnam, and I watched this program broken and eviscerated, as if itwere some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war, and I knew that Americawould never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so longas adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonicdestructive suction tube. So, I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy ofthe poor and to attack it as such.Perhaps a more tragic recognition of reality took place when it became clear to methat the war was doing far more than devastating the hopes of the poor at home. It wassending their sons and their brothers and their husbands to fight and to die inextraordinarily high proportions relative to the rest of the population. We were takingthe black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousandmiles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in southwestGeorgia and East Harlem. And so we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watchingNegro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that hasbeen unable to seat them together in the same schools. And so we watch them in brutalsolidarity burning the huts of a poor village, but we realize that they would hardly live on the same block in Chicago. I could not be silent in the face of such cruel manipulationof the poor.My third reason moves to an even deeper level of awareness, for it grows out of myexperience in the ghettoes of the North over the last three years -- especially the lastthree summers. As I have walked among the desperate, rejected, and angry young men, I havetold them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems. I have triedto offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social changecomes most meaningfully through nonviolent action. But they ask -- and rightly so --what about Vietnam? They ask if our own nation wasn't using massive doses of violence tosolve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted. Their questions hit home, and Iknew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in theghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in theworld today -- my own government. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of thisgovernment, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.For those who ask the question, Aren't you a civil rights leader? andthereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace, I have this further answer. In1957 when a group of us formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, we chose asour motto: To save the soul of America. We were convinced that we could notlimit our vision to certain rights for black people, but instead affirmed the convictionthat America would never be free or saved from itself until the descendants of its slaveswere loosed completely from the shackles they still wear. In a way we were agreeing withLangston Hughes, that black bard of Harlem, who had written earlier:O, yes,  I say it plain,  America never was America to me,  And yet I swear this oath --  America will be!Now, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for theintegrity and life of America today can ignore the present war. If America's soul becomestotally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read: Vietnam. It can never be saved so long asit destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over. So it is that those of us who are yetdetermined that America will be -- are -- are led down the path of protest and dissent, working forthe health of our land.As if the weight of such a commitment to the life and health of America were notenough, another burden of responsibility was placed upon me in 19541; and I cannot forgetthat the Nobel Peace Prize was also a commission, a commission to work harder than Ihad ever worked before for the brotherhood of man. This is a calling thattakes me beyond national allegiances, but even if it were not present I would yet have tolive with the meaning of my commitment to the ministry of Jesus Christ. To me therelationship of this ministry to the making of peace is so obvious that I sometimes marvelat those who ask me why I'm speaking against the war. Could it be that they do not knowthat the good news was meant for all men -- for Communist and capitalist, for theirchildren and ours, for black and for white, for revolutionary and conservative? Have theyforgotten that my ministry is in obedience to the One who loved his enemies so fully thathe died for them? What then can I say to the Vietcong or to Castro or to Maoas a faithful minister of this One? Can I threaten them with death or must I not sharewith them my life?And finally, as I try to explain for you and for myself the road that leads fromMontgomery to this place I would have offered all that was most valid if I simply saidthat I must be true to my conviction that I share with all men the calling to be a son ofthe living God. Beyond the calling of race or nation or creed is this vocation of sonshipand brotherhood, and because I believe that the Father is deeply concerned especially forhis suffering and helpless and outcast children, I come tonight to speak for them. This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves boundby allegiances and loyalties which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which gobeyond our nation's self-defined goals and positions. We are called to speak for the weak,for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation and for those it calls enemy, for no documentfrom human hands can make these humans any less our brothers.And as I ponder the madness of Vietnam and search within myself for ways to understand and respond in compassion, my mind goes constantly to the people of that peninsula. I speak now not of the soldiers of each side, not of the ideologies of the Liberation Front, not of the junta in Saigon, but simply of the people who have been living under the curse of war for almost three continuous decades now. I think of them, too, because it is clear to me that there will be no meaningful solution there until some attempt is made to know them and hear their broken cries.They must see Americans as strange liberators. The Vietnamese people   proclaimed their own independence in 1954   -- in 1945 rather   -- after a combined French and Japanese occupation and before the communist   revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. Even though they quoted the   American Declaration of Independence in their own document of freedom, we   refused to recognize them. Instead, we decided to support France in its reconquest of her former colony. Our government felt then that the Vietnamese   people were not ready for independence, and we again fell victim to the deadly   Western arrogance that has poisoned the international atmosphere for so long.   With that tragic decision we rejected a revolutionary government seeking   self-determination and a government that had been established not by China --   for whom the Vietnamese have no great love -- but by clearly indigenous forces   that included some communists. For the peasants this new government meant real   land reform, one of the most important needs in their lives.  For nine years following 1945 we denied the   people of Vietnam the right of independence. For nine years we vigorously   supported the French in their abortive effort to recolonize Vietnam. Before   the end of the war we were meeting eighty percent of the French war costs.   Even before the French were defeated at Dien Bien Phu, they began to despair   of their reckless action, but we did not. We encouraged them with our huge   financial and military supplies to continue the war even after they had lost   the will. Soon we would be paying almost the full costs of this tragic attempt   at recolonization.After the French were defeated, it looked as if   independence and land reform would come again through the Geneva Agreement.   But instead there came the United States, determined that Ho should not unify   the temporarily divided nation, and the peasants watched again as we supported   one of the most vicious modern dictators, our chosen man, Premier Diem. The   peasants watched and cringed as Diem ruthlessly rooted out all opposition,   supported their extortionist landlords, and refused even to discuss   reunification with the North. The peasants watched as all this was presided   over by United States' influence and then by increasing numbers of United   States troops who came to help quell the insurgency that Diem's methods had   aroused. When Diem was overthrown they may have been happy, but the long line   of military dictators seemed to offer no real change, especially in terms of   their need for land and peace.  The only change came from America, as we   increased our troop commitments in support of governments which were   singularly corrupt, inept, and without popular support. All the while the   people read our leaflets and received the regular promises of peace and   democracy and land reform. Now they languish under our bombs and consider us,   not their fellow Vietnamese, the real enemy. They move sadly and apathetically   as we herd them off the land of their fathers into concentration camps where   minimal social needs are rarely met. They know they must move on or be   destroyed by our bombs.  So they go, primarily women and children and   the aged. They watch as we poison their water, as we kill a million acres of   their crops. They must weep as the bulldozers roar through their areas   preparing to destroy the precious trees. They wander into the hospitals with   at least twenty casualties from American firepower for one Vietcong-inflicted   injury. So far we may have killed a million of them, mostly children. They   wander into the towns and see thousands of the children, homeless, without   clothes, running in packs on the streets like animals. They see the children   degraded by our soldiers as they beg for food. They see the children selling   their sisters to our soldiers, soliciting for their mothers.  What do the peasants think as we ally ourselves with the landlords and as we   refuse to put any action into our many words concerning land reform? What do   they think as we test out our latest weapons on them, just as the Germans   tested out new medicine and new tortures in the concentration camps of Europe?   Where are the roots of the independent Vietnam we claim to be building? Is it   among these voiceless ones?  We have destroyed their two most cherished   institutions: the family and the village. We have destroyed their land and   their crops. We have cooperated in the crushing -- in the crushing of the nation's only   non-Communist revolutionary political force, the unified Buddhist Church. We   have supported the enemies of the peasants of Saigon. We have corrupted their   women and children and killed their men.  Now there is little left to build on, save   bitterness. Soon, the only solid -- solid physical foundations remaining will be found at our military bases and in the concrete of the concentration camps we call fortified hamlets. The peasants may well wonder if we plan to build our new Vietnam on such grounds as these. Could we blame them for such thoughts? We must speak for them and raise the questions they cannot raise. These, too, are our brothers.  Perhaps a more difficult but no less necessary task is to speak for those who have been designated as our enemies.   What of the National Liberation Front, that strangely anonymous group we call   VC or communists? What must they think of the United States of America   when they realize that we permitted the repression and cruelty of Diem, which   helped to bring them into being as a resistance group in the South? What do   they think of our condoning the violence which led to their own taking up of   arms? How can they believe in our integrity when now we speak of aggression   from the North as if there were nothing more essential to the war? How can   they trust us when now we charge them with violence after the murderous reign   of Diem and charge them with violence while we pour every new weapon of death   into their land? Surely we must understand their feelings, even if we do not   condone their actions. Surely we must see that the men we supported pressed   them to their violence. Surely we must see that our own computerized plans of   destruction simply dwarf their greatest acts.  How do they judge us when our officials know   that their membership is less than twenty-five percent communist, and yet   insist on giving them the blanket name? What must they be thinking when they   know that we are aware of their control of major sections of Vietnam, and yet   we appear ready to allow national elections in which this highly organized   political parallel government will not have a part? They ask how we can speak   of free elections when the Saigon press is censored and controlled by the   military junta. And they are surely right to wonder what kind of new   government we plan to help form without them, the only party in real touch   with the peasants. They question our political goals and they deny the reality   of a peace settlement from which they will be excluded. Their questions are   frighteningly relevant. Is our nation planning to build on political myth   again, and then shore it up upon the power of new violence?  Here is the true meaning and value of   compassion and nonviolence, when it helps us to see the enemy's point of view,   to hear his questions, to know his assessment of ourselves. For from his view   we may indeed see the basic weaknesses of our own condition, and if we are   mature, we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of the brothers who   are called the opposition.  So, too, with Hanoi. In the North, where our   bombs now pummel the land, and our mines endanger the waterways, we are met by   a deep but understandable mistrust. To speak for them is to explain this lack   of confidence in Western words, and especially their distrust of American   intentions now. In Hanoi are the men who led the nation to independence   against the Japanese and the French, the men who sought membership in the   French Commonwealth and were betrayed by the weakness of Paris and the   willfulness of the colonial armies. It was they who led a second struggle   against French domination at tremendous costs, and then were persuaded to give   up the land they controlled between the thirteenth and seventeenth parallel as   a temporary measure at Geneva. After 1954 they watched us conspire with Diem   to prevent elections which could have surely brought Ho Chi Minh to power over   a united Vietnam, and they realized they had been betrayed again. When we ask   why they do not leap to negotiate, these things must be remembered.  Also, it must be clear that the leaders of   Hanoi considered the presence of American troops in support of the Diem regime   to have been the initial military breach of the Geneva Agreement concerning   foreign troops. They remind us that they did not begin to send troops in large   numbers and even supplies into the South until American forces had moved into   the tens of thousands.  Hanoi remembers how our leaders refused to tell   us the truth about the earlier North Vietnamese overtures for peace, how the   president claimed that none existed when they had clearly been made. Ho Chi   Minh has watched as America has spoken of peace and built up its forces, and   now he has surely heard the increasing international rumors of American plans   for an invasion of the North. He knows the bombing and shelling and mining we   are doing are part of traditional pre-invasion strategy. Perhaps only his   sense of humor and of irony can save him when he hears the most powerful   nation of the world speaking of aggression as it drops thousands of bombs on a   poor, weak nation more than eight hundred -- rather, eight thousand miles   away from its shores.  At this point I should make it clear that while   I have tried in these last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless in   Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who are called enemy, I am   as deeply concerned about our own troops there as anything else. For it occurs   to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the   brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and   seek to destroy. We are adding cynicism to the process of death, for they must   know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be   fighting for are really involved. Before long they must know that their   government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese, and the more   sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy, and the   secure, while we create a hell for the poor.  Somehow this madness must cease. We must stop   now. I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam. I   speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being   destroyed, whose culture is being subverted. I speak of the -- for the poor of America   who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home, and death and   corruption in Vietnam. I speak as a citizen of the world, for the world as it   stands aghast at the path we have taken. I speak as one who loves America, to   the leaders of our own nation: The great initiative in this war is ours; the   initiative to stop it must be ours.  This is the message of the great Buddhist   leaders of Vietnam. Recently one of them wrote these words, and I quote:  Each day the war goes on the hatred increases in the heart of the Vietnamese and in the hearts of those of humanitarian instinct. The Americans are forcing even their friends into becoming their enemies. It is curious that the Americans, who calculate so carefully on the possibilities of military victory, do not realize that in the process they are incurring deep psychological and political defeat. The image of America will never again be the image of revolution, freedom, and democracy, but the image of violence and militarism (unquote).If we continue, there will be no doubt in my   mind and in the mind of the world that we have no honorable intentions in   Vietnam. If we do not stop our war against the people of Vietnam immediately,   the world will be left with no other alternative than to see this as some   horrible, clumsy, and deadly game we have decided to play. The world now   demands a maturity of America that we may not be able to achieve. It demands   that we admit that we have been wrong from the beginning of our adventure in   Vietnam, that we have been detrimental to the life of the Vietnamese people.   The situation is one in which we must be ready to turn sharply from our   present ways. In order to atone for our sins and errors in Vietnam, we should   take the initiative in bringing a halt to this tragic war.  I would like to suggest five concrete things that our government should do [immediately] to begin the long and difficult process of extricating ourselves from this nightmarish conflict:Number one: End all bombing in North and South   Vietnam.  Number two: Declare a unilateral cease-fire in the hope that such action will   create the atmosphere for negotiation.  Three: Take immediate steps to prevent other battlegrounds in Southeast Asia   by curtailing our military buildup in Thailand and our interference in Laos.  Four: Realistically accept the fact that the National Liberation Front has   substantial support in South Vietnam and must thereby play a role in any   meaningful negotiations and any future Vietnam government.  Five: Set a date that we will remove all foreign troops from Vietnam in   accordance with the 1954 Geneva Agreement.  Part of our ongoing -- Part of our ongoing   commitment might well express itself in an offer to grant asylum to any   Vietnamese who fears for his life under a new regime which included the   Liberation Front. Then we must make what reparations we can for the damage we   have done. We must provide the medical aid that is badly needed, making it   available in this country, if necessary. Meanwhile -- Meanwhile, we in the   churches and synagogues have a continuing task while we urge our government to   disengage itself from a disgraceful commitment. We must continue to raise our   voices and our lives if our nation persists in its perverse ways in Vietnam.   We must be prepared to match actions with words by seeking out every creative   method of protest possible.As we counsel young men concerning military service, we must clarify for them our nation's role in Vietnam and challenge them with the alternative of conscientious objection. I am pleased to say that this is a path now chosen by more than seventy students at my own alma mater, Morehouse College, and I recommend it to all who find the American course in Vietnam a dishonorable and unjust one. Moreover, I would encourage all ministers of draft age to give up their ministerial exemptions and seek status as conscientious objectors. These are the times for real choices and not false   ones. We are at the moment when our lives must be placed on the line if our   nation is to survive its own folly. Every man of humane convictions must   decide on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all   protest.  Now there is something seductively tempting   about stopping there and sending us all off on what in some circles has become   a popular crusade against the war in Vietnam. I say we must enter that   struggle, but I wish to go on now to say something even more disturbing.The war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American   spirit, and if we ignore this sobering reality...and if we ignore this sobering   reality, we will find ourselves organizing clergy and laymen concerned   committees for the next generation. They will be concerned about Guatemala -- Guatemala and   Peru. They will be concerned about Thailand and Cambodia. They will be   concerned about Mozambique and South Africa. We will be marching for these and   a dozen other names and attending rallies without end, unless there is a   significant and profound change in American life and policy.And so, such thoughts   take us beyond Vietnam, but not beyond our calling as sons of the living God.  In 1957, a sensitive American official overseas   said that it seemed to him that our nation was on the wrong side of a world   revolution. During the past ten years, we have seen emerge a pattern of   suppression which has now justified the presence of U.S. military advisors in   Venezuela. This need to maintain social stability for our investments accounts   for the counterrevolutionary action of American forces in Guatemala. It tells   why American helicopters are being used against guerrillas in Cambodia and why   American napalm and Green Beret forces have already been active against rebels   in Peru.  It is with such activity in mind that the words   of the late John F. Kennedy come back to haunt us. Five years ago he said,   Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution   inevitable. Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our   nation has taken, the role of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by   refusing to give up the privileges and the pleasures that come from the   immense profits of overseas investments. I am convinced that if we are to get   on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a   radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin...we must rapidly begin   the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When   machines and computers, profit motives and property rights, are  considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme   materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and   justice of many of our past and present policies. On the one hand, we are   called to play the Good Samaritan on life's roadside, but that will be only an   initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho Road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as   they make their journey on life's highway. True compassion is more than   flinging a coin to a beggar. It comes to see that an edifice which produces   beggars needs restructuring.A true revolution of values will soon look   uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous   indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of   the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa, and South America, only   to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the   countries, and say, This is not just. It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of South America and say, This is not just. The Western   arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just.  A true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order and say of war,   This way of settling differences is not just. This business of burning human   beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows, of   injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane,   of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped   and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and   love. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military   defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.  America, the richest and most powerful nation   in the world, can well lead the way in this revolution of values. There is   nothing except a tragic death wish to prevent us from reordering our   priorities so that the pursuit of peace will take precedence over the pursuit   of war. There is nothing to keep us from molding a recalcitrant status quo   with bruised hands until we have fashioned it into a brotherhood.  This kind of positive revolution of values is our best defense against communism. War is not the answer. Communism will never be defeated by the use of atomic bombs or nuclear weapons. Let us not join those who shout war and, through their misguided passions, urge the United States to relinquish its participation in the United Nations. These are days which demand wise   restraint and calm reasonableness. We must not engage in a negative anticommunism, but rather in a positive thrust for democracy, realizing that our greatest defens",,,42," William Jennings Bryan -- Against Imperialism  William Jennings BryanImperialism (Flag of an Empire) delivered  8 August 1900, Indianapolis, INAudio  Excerpt Studio Reading of Address  );  "", ""wjbryanimperialismgo."");   ;   for flash  Mr.  Chairman and Members of the Notification Committee:I  shall, at an early day, and in a more formal manner, accept the nomination  which you tender, and shall at that time discuss the various questions  covered by the Democratic platform. It  may not be out of place, however, to submit a few observations at this  time upon the general character of the contest before us and upon the  question which is declared to be of paramount importance in this campaign.  When  I say that the contest of 1900 is a contest of 1900 is a contest between  Democracy on the one hand and plutocracy on the other I do not mean to say  that all our opponents have deliberately chosen to give to organized  wealth a predominating influence in the affairs of the Government, but I  do assert that on the important issues of the day the Republican party is  dominated by those influences which constantly tend to substitute the  worship of mammon for the protection of the rights of man.  In  1859 Lincoln said that the Republican Party believed in the man and the  dollar, but that in case of conflict it believed in the man before the  dollar. This is the proper  relation which should exist between the two.Man, the handiwork of God, comes first; money, the handiwork of  man, is of inferior importance. Man  is the master, money the servant, but upon all important questions today  Republican legislation tends to make money the master and man the servant.  The  maxim of Jefferson, åÒequal rights to all and special privileges to  none,åÓ and the doctrine of Lincoln that this should be a government  åÒof the people, by the people and for the people,åÓ are being  disregarded and the instrumentalities of government are being used to  advance the interests of those who are in a position to secure favors from  the Government.  The  Democratic party is not making war upon the honest acquisition of wealth;  it has no desire to discourage industry, economy, and thrift.  On the contrary, it gives to every citizen the greatest possible  stimulus to honest toil when it promises him protection in the enjoyment  of the proceeds of his labor. Property  rights are most secure when human rights are most respected.  Democracy strives for civilization in which every member of society  will share according to his merits.  No one has a right to expect from a society more than a fair compensation  for the services No one has a right to expect from a society more than a  fair compensation for the services which he renders to society. If he  secures more it is at the expense of some one else. It is no injustice to  him to prevent his doing injustice to another. To him who would, either  through class legislation or in the absence of necessary legislation,  trespass upon the rights of another the Democratic party says Thou  shalt not.  Against us are arrayed a comparatively small but politically and  financially powerful number who really profit by Republican policies; but  with them are associated a large number who, because of their attachment  to their party name, are giving their support to doctrines antagonistic to  the former teachings of their own party.  Republicans who used to advocate bimetallism now try to convince  themselves that the gold standard is good; Republicans who were formerly  attached to the greenback are now seeking an excuse for giving national  banks control of the nation's paper money; Republicans who used to boast  that the Republican party was paying off the national debt are now looking  for reasons to support a perpetual and increasing debt; Republicans who  formerly abhorred a trust now beguile themselves with the delusion that  there are good trusts, and bad trusts, while in their minds, the line  between the two is becoming more and more obscure; Republicans who, in  times past, congratulated the country upon the small expense of our  standing army, are now making light of the objections which are urged  against a large increase in the permanent military establishment;  Republicans who gloried in our independence when the nation was less  powerful now look with favor upon a foreign alliance; Republicans who  three years ago condemned forcible annexation as immoral and  even criminal are now sure that it is both immoral and criminal to oppose  forcible annexation. That partisanship has already blinded many to present  dangers is certain; how large a portion of the Republican party can be  drawn over to the new policies remains to be seen.For a time Republican leaders were inclined to deny to opponents the  right to criticize the Philippine policy of the administration, but upon  investigation they found that both Lincoln and Clay asserted and exercised  the right to criticize a President during the progress of the Mexican war.  Instead of meeting the issue boldly and submitting a clear and positive  plan for dealing with the Philippine question, the Republican convention  adopted a platform the larger part of which was devoted to boasting and  self-congratulation.  In attempting to press economic questions upon the country to the  exclusion of those which involve the very structure of our government, the  Republican leaders give new evidence of their abandonment of the earlier  ideals of their party and of their complete subservience to pecuniary  considerations.  But they shall not be permitted to evade the stupendous and far-reaching  issue which they have deliberately brought into the arena of politics.  When the president, supported by a practically unanimous vote of the House  and Senate, entered upon a war with Spain for the purpose of aiding the  struggling patriots of Cuba, the country, without regard to party,  applauded.  Although the Democrats realized that the administration would necessarily  gain a political advantage from the conduct of a war which in the very  nature of the case must soon end in a complete victory, they vied with the  Republicans in the support which they gave to the president. When the war  was over and the Republican leaders began to suggest the propriety of a  colonial policy opposition at once manifested itself.  When the President finally laid before the Senate a treaty which  recognized the independence of Cuba, but provided for the cession of the  Philippine Islands to the United States, the menace of imperialism became  so apparent that many preferred to reject the treaty and risk the ills  that might follow rather than take the chance of correcting the errors of  the treaty by the independent action of this country.  I was among the number of those who believed it better to ratify the  treaty and end the war, release the volunteers, remove the excuse for war  expenditures and then give the Filipinos the independence which might be  forced from Spain by a new treaty.  In view of the criticism which my action aroused in some quarters, I take  this occasion to restate the reasons given at that time. I thought it  safer to trust the American people to give independence to the Filipinos  than to trust the accomplishment of that purpose to diplomacy with an  unfriendly nation.  Lincoln embodied an argument in the question when he asked, Can  aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws? I believe  that we are now in a better position to wage a successful contest against  imperialism than we would have been had the treaty been rejected. With the  treaty ratified a clean-cut issue is presented between a government by  consent and a government by force, and imperialists must bear the  responsibility for all that happens until the question is settled.  If the treaty had been rejected the opponents of imperialism would have  been held responsible for any international complications which might have  arisen before the ratification of another treaty. But whatever difference  of opinion may have existed as to the best method of opposing a colonial  policy, there never was any difference as to the great importance of the  question and there is no difference now as to the course to be pursued.  The title of Spain being extinguished we were at liberty to deal with the  Filipinos according to American principles. The Bacon resolution,  introduced a month before hostilities broke out at Manila, promised  independence to the Filipinos on the same terms that it was promised to  the Cubans. I supported this resolution and believe that its adoption  prior to the breaking out of hostilities would have prevented bloodshed,  and that its adoption at any subsequent time would have ended hostilities.  If the treaty had been rejected considerable time would have necessarily  elapsed before a new treaty could have been agreed upon and ratified and  during that time the question would have been agitating the public mind.  If the Bacon resolution had been adopted by the senate and carried out by  the president, either at the time of the ratification of the treaty or at  any time afterwards, it would have taken the question of imperialism out  of politics and left the American people free to deal with their domestic  problems. But the resolution was defeated by the vote of the Republican  Vice-President, and from that time to this a republican congress has  refused to take any action whatever in the matter.  When hostilities broke out at Manila republican speakers and Republican  editors at once sought to lay the blame upon those who had delayed the  ratification of the treaty, and, during the progress of the war, the same  republicans have accused the opponents of imperialism of giving  encouragement to the Filipinos. This is a cowardly evasion of  responsibility.  If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands  permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies,  the Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it  must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to  resist to the extent of their ability.The Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans now living.  Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but  to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the republicans  are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated to make the  Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick  Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, Give me liberty or  give me death, he expressed a sentiment which still echoes in the  hearts of men.  Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have  used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political  bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must  choose between liberty and slavery. Or, if the statute of limitations has  run again the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure  Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular  government when the present advocates of force and conquest are forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken, can never be recalled. It  goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence.  But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or spoken in  defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration  of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of  perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart  the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so low in the scale of  civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must  consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they  must also calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the  Philippines without weakening that principle here.Lincoln said that the safety of this Nation was not in its fleets, its  armies, or its forts, but in the spirit which prizes liberty as the  heritage of all men, in all lands, everywhere, and he warned his  countrymen that they could not destroy this spirit without planting the  seeds of despotism at their own doors.Even now we are beginning to see the paralyzing influence if imperialism.  Heretofore this Nation has been prompt to express its sympathy with  those who were fighting for civil liberty.  While our sphere of activity has been limited to the Western  Hemisphere, our sympathies have not been bounded by the seas.  We have felt it due to ourselves and to the world, as well as to  those who were struggling for the right to govern themselves, to proclaim  the interest which our people have, from the date of their own  independence, felt in every contest between human rights and arbitrary  power.Three-quarters of a century ago, when our nation was small, the struggles  of Greece aroused our people, and Webster and Clay gave eloquent  expression to the universal desire for Grecian independence. In 1896 all  parties manifested a lively interest in the success of the Cubans, but now  when a war is in progress in South Africa, which must result in the  extension of the monarchical idea, or in the triumph of a republic, the  advocates of imperialism in this country dare not say a word in behalf of  the Boers.Sympathy for the Boers does not arise from any unfriendliness towards  England; the American people are not unfriendly toward the people of any  nation. This sympathy is due to the fact that, as stated in our platform,  we believe in the principles of self-government and reject, as did our  forefathers, the claims of monarchy. If this nation surrenders its belief  in the universal application of the principles set forth in the  Declaration of Independence, it will lose the prestige and influence which  it has enjoyed among the nations as an exponent of popular government.Our opponents, conscious of the weakness of their cause, seek to confuse  imperialism with expansion, and have even dared to claim Jefferson as a  supporter of their policy. Jefferson spoke so freely and used language  with such precision that no one can be ignorant of his views. On one  occasion he declared: If there be one principle more deeply rooted  than any other in the mind of every American, it is that we should have  nothing to do with conquest. And again he said: Conquest is  not in our principles; it is inconsistent with our government.The forcible annexation of territory to be governed by arbitrary power  differs as much from the acquisition of territory to be built up into  States as a monarchy differs from a democracy. The Democratic party does  not oppose expansion when expansion enlarges the area of the Republic and  incorporates land which can be settled by American citizens, or adds to  our population people who are willing to become citizens and are capable  of discharging their duties as such.The acquisition of the Louisiana territory, Florida, Texas and other  tracts which have been secured from time to time enlarged the republic and  the Constitution followed the flag into the new territory. It is now  proposed to seize upon distant territory already more densely populated  than our own country and to force upon the people a government for which  there is no warrant in our Constitution or our laws.Even the argument that this earth belongs to those who desire to  cultivate it and who have the physical power to acquire it cannot be  invoked to justify the appropriation of the Philippine Islands by the  United States. If the islands were uninhabited American citizens would not  be willing to go there and till the soil. The white race will not live so  near the equator. Other nations have tried to colonize in the same  latitude. The Netherlands have controlled Java for three hundred years and  yet today there are less than sixty thousand people of European birth  scattered among the twenty-five million natives.  After a century and a half of English domination in India, less than  one-twentieth of one per cent of the people of India are of English birth,  and it requires an army of seventy thousand British soldiers to take care  of the tax collectors. Spain had asserted title to the Philippine Islands  for three centuries and yet when our fleet entered Manila bay there were  less than ten thousand Spaniards residing in the Philippines.  A colonial policy means that we shall send to the Philippine Islands a  few traders, a few taskmasters and a few office-holders and an army large  enough to support the authority of a small fraction of the people while  they rule the natives.If we have an imperial policy we must have a great standing army as its  natural and necessary complement. The  sprit which will justify the forcible annexation of the Philippine Islands  will justify the seizure of other islands and the domination of other  people, and with wars of conquest we can expect a certain, if not rapid,  growth of our military establishment.  That a large permanent increase in our regular army is intended by  Republican leaders is not a matter of conjecture, but a matter of fact. In  his message of December 5,1898, the president asked for authority to  increase the standing army to 100,000. In 1896 the army contained about  25,000. Within two years the president asked for four times that many, and  a Republican house of representatives complied with the request after the  Spanish treaty had been signed, and when no country was at war with the  United States.  If such an army is demanded when an imperial policy is contemplated, but  not openly avowed, what may be expected if the people encourage the  Republican party by indorsing its policy at the polls?  A large standing army is not only a pecuniary burden to the people and,  if accompanied by compulsory service, a constant source of irritation, but  it is ever a menace to a Republican form of government.  The army is the personification of force, and militarism will inevitably  change the ideals of the people and turn the thoughts of our young men  from the arts of peace to the science of war. The Government which relies  for its defense upon its citizens is more likely to be just than one which  has at call a large body of professional soldiers.  A small standing army and a well-equipped and well-disciplined state  militia are sufficient at ordinary times, and in an emergency the nation  should in the future as in the past place its dependence upon the  volunteers who come from all occupations at their country's call and  return to productive labor when their services are no longer required --  men who fight when the country needs fighters and work when the country  needs workers. The Republican platform assumes that the Philippine Islands  will be retained under American sovereignty, and we have a right to demand  of the republican leaders a discussion of the future status of the  Filipino. Is he to be a citizen or a subject? Are we to bring into the  body politic eight or ten million Asiatics so different from us in race  and history that amalgamation is impossible? Are they to share with us in  making the laws and shaping the destiny of this nation? No republican of  prominence has been bold enough to advocate such a proposition.  The McEnery resolution, adopted by the senate immediately after the  ratification of the treaty, expressly negatives this idea. The Democratic  platform describes the situation when it says that the Filipinos cannot be  citizens without endangering our civilization. Who will dispute it? And  what is the alternative? If the Filipino is not to be a citizen, shall we  make him a subject? On that question the Democratic platform speaks with  equal emphasis. It declares that the Filipino cannot be a subject without  endangering our form of government. A republic can have no subjects. A  subject is possible only in a government resting upon force; he is unknown  in a government derived without consent and taxation without  representation.The Republican platform says that the largest measure of  self-government consistent with their welfare and our duties shall be  secured to them (the Filipinos) by law. This is a strange doctrine  for a government which owes its very existence to the men who offered  their lives as a protest against government without consent and taxation  without representation. In what respect does the position of the  Republican party differ from the position taken by the English Government  in 1776? Did not the English Government promise a good government to the  colonists? What king ever promised a bad government to his people? Did not  the English Government promise that the colonists should have the largest  measure of self-government consistent with their welfare and English  duties? Did not the Spanish Government promise to give to the Cubans the  largest measure of self-government consistent with their welfare and  Spanish duties? The whole difference between a monarchy and a republic may  be summed up in one sentence. In a monarchy the king gives to the people  what he believes to be a good government; in a republic the people secure  for themselves what they believe to be a good government.The Republican party has accepted the European idea and planted itself  upon the ground taken by George III., and by every ruler who distrusts the  capacity of the people for self-government or denies them a voice in their  own affairs.  The Republican platform promises that some measure of self-government is  to be given the Filipinos by law; but even this pledge is not fulfilled.  Nearly sixteen months elapsed after the ratification of the treaty before  the adjournment of congress last June and yet no law was passed dealing  with the Philippine situation. The will of the president has been the only  law in the Philippine islands wherever the American authority extends. Why  does the Republican party hesitate to legislate upon the Philippine  question? Because a law would disclose the radical departure from history  and precedent contemplated by those who control the Republican party. The  storm of protest which greeted the Puerto Rican bill was an indication of  what may be expected when the American people are brought face to face  with legislation upon this subject.  If the Puerto Ricans, who welcomed annexation, are to be denied the  guarantees of our Constitution, what is to be the lot of the Filipinos,  who resisted our authority? If secret influences could compel a disregard  of our plain duty toward friendly people, living near our shores, what  treatment will those same influences provide for unfriendly people 7,000  miles away? If, in this country where the people have a right to vote,  republican leaders dare not take the side of the people against the great  monopolies which have grown up within the last few years, how can they be  trusted to protect the Filipinos from the corporations which are waiting  to exploit the islands?Is the sunlight of full citizenship to be enjoyed by the people of the  United States, and the twilight of semi-citizenship endured by the people  of Puerto Rico, while the thick darkness of perpetual vassalage covers the  Philippines? The Puerto Rico tariff law asserts the doctrine that the  operation of the constitution is confined to the forty-five states.  The Democratic party disputes this doctrine and denounces it as repugnant  to both the letter and spirit of our organic law. There is no place in our  system of government for the deposit of arbitrary and irresponsible power.  That the leaders of a great party should claim for any president or  congress the right to treat millions of people as mere  possessions and deal with them unrestrained by the  constitution or the bill of rights shows how far we have already departed  from the ancient landmarks and indicates what may be expected if this  nation deliberately enters upon a career of empire.  The territorial form of government is temporary and preparatory, and the  chief security a citizen of a territory has is found in the fact that he  enjoys the same constitutional guarantees and is subject to the same  general laws as the citizen of a state. Take away this security and his  rights will be violated and his interests sacrificed at the demand of  those who have political influence. This is the evil of the colonial  system, no matter by what nation it is applied.  What is our title to the Philippine Islands? Do we hold them by treaty or  by conquest? Did we buy them or did we take them? Did we purchase the  people? If not, how did we secure title to them? Were they thrown in with  the land? Will the Republicans say that inanimate earth has value but that  when that earth is molded by the divine hand and stamped with the likeness  of the Creator it becomes a fixture and passes with the soil? If  governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, it  is impossible to secure title to people, either by force or by purchase.  We could extinguish Spain's title by treaty, but if we hold title we must  hold it by some method consistent with our ideas of government. When we  made allies of the Filipinos and armed them to fight against Spain, we  disputed Spain's title. If we buy Spain's title we are not innocent  purchasers.  There can be no doubt that we accepted and utilized the services of the  Filipinos, and that when we did so we had full knowledge that they were  fighting for their own independence, and I submit that history furnishes  no example of turpitude baser than ours if we now substitute our yoke for  the Spanish yoke.Let us consider briefly the reasons which have been given in support of  an imperialistic policy. Some say that it is our duty to hold the  Philippine Islands. But duty is not an argument; it is a conclusion. To  ascertain what our duty is, in any emergency, we must apply well settled  and generally accepted principles. It is our duty to avoid stealing, no  matter whether the thing to be stolen is of great or little value. It is  our duty to avoid killing a human being, no matter where the human being  lives or to what race or class he belongs.  Every one recognizes the obligation imposed upon individuals to observe  both the human and the moral law, but as some deny the application of  those laws to nations, it may not be out of place to quote the opinions of  others. Jefferson, than whom there is no higher political authority, said: I know of but one code of morality for men, whether acting singly  or collectively.  Franklin, whose learning, wisdom and virtue are a part of the priceless  legacy bequeathed to use from the revolutionary days, expressed the same  idea in even stronger language when he said:  Justice is strictly due between neighbor nations as between neighbor citizens. A highwayman is as much a robber when he plunders in a gang as when single; and the nation that makes an unjust war is only a great gang.  Many may dare to do in crowds what they would not dare to do as  individuals, but the moral character of an act is not determined by the  number of those who join it. Force can defend a right, but force has never  yet created a right. If it was true, as declared in the resolutions of  intervention, that the Cubans are and of right ought to be free and  independent (language taken from the Declaration  of Independence), it is equally true that the Filipinos are and  of right ought to be free and independent.  The right of the Cubans to freedom was not based upon their proximity to  the United States, nor upon the language which they spoke, nor yet upon  the race or races to which they belonged. Congress by a practically  unanimous vote declared that the principles enunciated at Philadelphia in  1776 were still alive and applicable to the Cubans. Who will draw a line  between the natural rights of the Cubans and the Filipinos? Who will say  that the former has a right to liberty and that the latter has no rights  which we are bound to respect? And, if the Filipinos are and of  right ought to be free and independent, what right have we to force  our government upon them without their consent? Before our duty can be  ascertained their rights must be determined, and when their rights are  once determined it is as much our duty to respect those rights as it was  the duty of Spain to respect the rights of the people of Cuba or the duty  of England to respect the rights of the American colonists. Rights never  conflict; duties never clash. Can it be our duty to usurp political rights  which belong to others? Can it be our duty to kill those who, following  the example of our forefathers, love liberty well enough to fight for it?A  poet has described the terror which overcame a soldier who in the midst of  the battle discovered that he had slain his brother. It is written  All ye are brethren. Let us hope for the coming day when human  life -- which when once destroyed cannot be restored -- will be so sacred  that it will never be taken except when necessary to punish a crime  already committed, or to prevent a crime about to be committed.It  is said that we have assumed before the world obligations which make it  necessary for us to permanently maintain a government in the Philippine  Islands. I reply first, that the highest obligation of this nation is to  be true to itself. No obligation to any particular nations, or to all the  nations combined, can require the abandonment of our theory of government,  and the substitution of doctrines against which our whole national life  has been a protest. And, second, that our obligation to the Filipinos, who  inhabit the islands, is greater than any obligation which we can owe to  foreigners who have a temporary residence in the Philippines or desire to  trade there.It  is argued by some that the Filipinos are incapable of self-government and  that, therefore, we owe it to the world to take control of them. Admiral  Dewey, in an official report to the Navy Department, declared the  Filipinos more capable of self-government than the Cubans and said that he  based his opinion upon a knowledge of both races. But I will not rest the  case upon the relative advancement of the Filipinos.

(2)]Thank you very, very much,President Keohane. Mrs. Gorbachev, Trustees, faculty, parents, and I should say, JuliaPorter, class president, and certainly my new best friend, Christine Bicknell -- and, ofcourse, the Class of 1990. I am really thrilled to be here today, and very excited, as Iknow all of you must be, that Mrs. Gorbachev could join us.These -- These are exciting times. They're exciting in Washington, and I havereally looked forward to coming to Wellesley. I thought it was going to be fun. I neverdreamt it would be this much fun. So, thank you for that.More than ten years ago, when I was invited here to talk about ourexperiences in the People's Republic of China, I was struck by both the natural beauty ofyour campus and the spirit of this place.Wellesley, you see, is not just a place but an idea -- an experimentin excellence in which diversity is not just tolerated, but is embraced. The essence ofthis spirit was captured in a moving speech about tolerance given last year by a studentbody president of one of your sister colleges. She related the story by Robert Fulghumabout a young pastor, finding himself in charge of some very energetic children, hits uponthe game called Giants, Wizards, and Dwarfs. You have to decide now,the pastor instructed the children, which you are -- a giant, a wizard, or adwarf? At that, a small girl tugging at his pants leg, asked, But where do themermaids stand? And the pastor tells her there are no mermaids. And she says,Oh yes there are -- they are. I am a mermaid.Now this little girl knew what she was, and she was not about togive up on either her identity, or the game. She intended to take her place wherevermermaids fit into the scheme of things. Where do the mermaids stand? All of those who aredifferent, those who do not fit the boxes and the pigeonholes? Answer thatquestion, wrote Fulghum, And you can build a school, a nation, or a wholeworld. As that very wise young woman said, Diversity, like anything worthhaving, requires effort -- effort to learn about and respect difference, to be compassionatewith one another, to cherish our own identity, and to accept unconditionally the same inothers.You should all be very proud that this is the Wellesley spirit. NowI know your first choice today was Alice Walker -- guess how I know! -- known for TheColor Purple. Instead you got me -- known for the color of my hair. Alice Walker's bookhas a special resonance here. At Wellesley, each class is known by a special color. Forfour years the Class of '90 has worn the color purple. Today you meet on Severance Greento say goodbye to all of that, to begin a new and a very personal journey, to search foryour own true colors.In the world that awaits you, beyond the shores of Waban -- Lake Waban, noone can say what your true colors will be. But this I do know: You have a first classeducation from a first class school. And so you need not, probably cannot, live apaint-by-numbers life. Decisions are not irrevocable. Choices do come back.And as you set off from Wellesley, I hope that many of you will consider making three veryspecial choices.The first is to believe in something larger than yourself, to getinvolved in some of the big ideas of our time. I chose literacy because I honestly believethat if more people could read, write, and comprehend, we would be that much closer tosolving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our society.And early on I made another choice, which I hope you'll make as well.Whether you are talking about education, career, or service, you're talking about life --and life really must have joy. It's supposed to be fun.One of the reasons I made the most important decision of mylife, to marry George Bush, is because he made me laugh. It's true, sometimes we'velaughed through our tears, but that shared laughter has been one of our strongest bonds.Find the joy in life, because as Ferris Bueller said on his day off, Life movespretty fast; and you don't stop and look around once in a while, you're going to miss it.(I'm not going to tell George you clapped more for Ferris than youclapped for George.)The third choice that must not be missed is to cherish yourhuman connections: your relationships with family and friends. For several years, you'vehad impressed upon you the importance to your career of dedication and hard work. And, ofcourse, that's true. But as important as your obligations as a doctor, a lawyer, abusiness leader will be, you are a human being first. And those human connections --- withspouses, with children, with friends -- are the most important investments you will evermake.At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed onemore test, winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret timenot spent with a husband, a child, a friend, or a parent.We are in a transitional period right now -- We are in a transitional period right now, fascinating andexhilarating times, learning to adjust to changes and the choices we, men and women, arefacing. As an example, I remember what a friend said, on hearing her husband complain tohis buddies that he had to babysit. Quickly setting him straight, my friend toldher husband that when it's your own kids, it's not called babysitting. Now maybe we should adjust faster; maybe we should adjustslower. But whatever the era twenty -- whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will never change:fathers and mothers, if you have children, they must come first. You must read toyour children, and you must hug your children, and you must love your children. Yoursuccess as a family, our success as a society, depends not on what happens in the WhiteHouse, but on what happens inside your house.For over fifty years, it was said that the winner of Wellesley'sannual hoop race would be the first to get married. Now they say, the winner will be thefirst to become a C.E.O. Both -- Both of those stereotypes show too little tolerance for those whowant to know where the mermaids stand. So -- So I want to offer a new legend: the winner of thehoop race will be the first to realize her dream -- not society's dreams -- her ownpersonal dream.And who -- Who knows? Somewhere out in this audience may even be someonewho will one day follow in my footsteps, and preside over the White House as thePresident's spouse -- and I wish him well.Well, the controversy ends here. But our conversation is onlybeginning. And a worthwhile conversation it has been. So as you leave Wellesley today,take with you deep thanks for the courtesy and the honor you have shared with Mrs.Gorbachev and with me.Thank you. God bless you. And may your future be worthy of yourdreams.Book/CDs by Michael E.

KennedyCivil Rights Address delivered 11 June 1963Plug-in required for flash audiovar so = new );  "", ""jfkcivilrights."");   ; for flash]Good evening, my fellow citizens:This afternoon, following a series of threats and defiant statements, the presence of Alabama National Guardsmen was required on the University of Alabama to carry out the final and unequivocal order of the United States District Court of the Northern District of Alabama. That order called for the admission of two clearly qualified young Alabama residents who happened to have been born Negro. That they were admitted peacefully on the campus is due in good measure to the conduct of the students of the University of Alabama, who met their responsibilities in a constructive way.I hope that every American, regardless of where he lives, will stop and examine his conscience about this and other related incidents. This Nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds. It was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.Today, we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free. And when Americans are sent to Vietnam or West Berlin, we do not ask for whites only. It ought to be possible, therefore, for American students of any color to attend any public institution they select without having to be backed up by troops. It ought to to be possible for American consumers of any color to receive equal service in places of public accommodation, such as hotels and restaurants and theaters and retail stores, without being forced to resort to demonstrations in the street, and it ought to be possible for American citizens of any color to register and to vote in a free election without interference or fear of reprisal. It ought to to be possible, in short, for every American to enjoy the privileges of being American without regard to his race or his color. In short, every American ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated. But this is not the case.The Negro baby born in America today, regardless of the section of the State in which he is born, has about one-half as much chance of completing a high school as a white baby born in the same place on the same day, one-third as much chance of completing college, one-third as much chance of becoming a professional man, twice as much chance of becoming unemployed, about one-seventh as much chance of earning $10,000 a year, a life expectancy which is 7 years shorter, and the prospects of earning only half as much.This is not a sectional issue. Difficulties over segregation and discrimination exist in every city, in every State of the Union, producing in many cities a rising tide of discontent that threatens the public safety. Nor is this a partisan issue. In a time of domestic crisis men of good will and generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politics. This is not even a legal or legislative issue alone. It is better to settle these matters in the courts than on the streets, and new laws are needed at every level, but law alone cannot make men see right. We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated. If an American, because his skin is dark, cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public, if he cannot send his children to the best public school available, if he cannot vote for the public officials who will represent him, if, in short, he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place? Who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay?One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice. They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression. And this Nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free.We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to Negroes?Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them. The fires of frustration and discord are burning in every city, North and South, where legal remedies are not at hand. Redress is sought in the streets, in demonstrations, parades, and protests which create tensions and threaten violence and threaten lives.We face, therefore, a moral crisis as a country and a people. It cannot be met by repressive police action. It cannot be left to increased demonstrations in the streets. It cannot be quieted by token moves or talk. It is a time to act in the Congress, in your State and local legislative body and, above all, in all of our daily lives. It is not enough to pin the blame on others, to say this a problem of one section of the country or another, or deplore the facts that we face. A great change is at hand, and our task, our obligation, is to make that revolution, that change, peaceful and constructive for all. Those who do nothing are inviting shame, as well as violence. Those who act boldly are recognizing right, as well as reality.Next week I shall ask the Congress of the United States to act, to make a commitment it has not fully made in this century to the proposition that race has no place in American life or law. The Federal judiciary has upheld that proposition in a series of forthright cases. The Executive Branch has adopted that proposition in the conduct of its affairs, including the employment of Federal personnel, the use of Federal facilities, and the sale of federally financed housing. But there are other necessary measures which only the Congress can provide, and they must be provided at this session. The old code of equity law under which we live commands for every wrong a remedy, but in too many communities, in too many parts of the country, wrongs are inflicted on Negro citizens and there are no remedies at law. Unless the Congress acts, their only remedy is the street.I am, therefore, asking the Congress to enact legislation giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public -- hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments. This seems to me to be an elementary right. Its denial is an arbitrary indignity that no American in 1963 should have to endure, but many do.I have recently met with scores of business leaders urging them to take voluntary action to end this discrimination, and I have been encouraged by their response, and in the last two weeks over 75 cities have seen progress made in desegregating these kinds of facilities. But many are unwilling to act alone, and for this reason, nationwide legislation is needed if we are to move this problem from the streets to the courts.I'm also asking the Congress to authorize the Federal Government to participate more fully in lawsuits designed to end segregation in public education. We have succeeded in persuading many districts to desegregate voluntarily. Dozens have admitted Negroes without violence. Today, a Negro is attending a State-supported institution in every one of our 50 States, but the pace is very slow.Too many Negro children entering segregated grade schools at the time of the Supreme Court's decision nine years ago will enter segregated high schools this fall, having suffered a loss which can never be restored. The lack of an adequate education denies the Negro a chance to get a decent job.The orderly implementation of the Supreme Court decision, therefore, cannot be left solely to those who may not have the economic resources to carry the legal action or who may be subject to harassment.Other features will be also requested, including greater protection for the right to vote. But legislation, I repeat, cannot solve this problem alone. It must be solved in the homes of every American in every community across our country. In this respect I wanna pay tribute to those citizens North and South who've been working in their communities to make life better for all. They are acting not out of sense of legal duty but out of a sense of human decency. Like our soldiers and sailors in all parts of the world they are meeting freedom's challenge on the firing line, and I salute them for their honor and their courage.My fellow Americans, this is a problem which faces us all -- in every city of the North as well as the South. Today, there are Negroes unemployed, two or three times as many compared to whites, inadequate education, moving into the large cities, unable to find work, young people particularly out of work without hope, denied equal rights, denied the opportunity to eat at a restaurant or a lunch counter or go to a movie theater, denied the right to a decent education, denied almost today the right to attend a State university even though qualified. It seems to me that these are matters which concern us all, not merely Presidents or Congressmen or Governors, but every citizen of the United States.This is one country. It has become one country because all of us and all the people who came here had an equal chance to develop their talents. We cannot say to ten percent of the population that you can't have that right; that your children cannot have the chance to develop whatever talents they have; that the only way that they are going to get their rights is to go in the street and demonstrate. I think we owe them and we owe ourselves a better country than that.Therefore, I'm asking for your help in making it easier for us to move ahead and to provide the kind of equality of treatment which we would want ourselves; to give a chance for every child to be educated to the limit of his talents.As I've said before, not every child has an equal talent or an equal ability or equal motivation, but they should have the equal right to develop their talent and their ability and their motivation, to make something of themselves.We have a right to expect that the Negro community will be responsible, will uphold the law, but they have a right to expect that the law will be fair, that the Constitution will be color blind, as Justice Harlan said at the turn of the century.This is what we're talking about and this is a matter which concerns this country and what it stands for, and in meeting it I ask the support of all our citizens.Thank you very much.

KennedyCuban Missile Crisis Address to the Nation   delivered 22 October 1962Plug-in required for flash audiovar so = new );  "", ""jfkcubanmissilecrisis994449."");   ; for flash[  fromaudio.]Good evening, my fellow citizens: This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillanceof the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week,unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensivemissile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purposeof these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capabilityagainst the Western Hemisphere.Upon receiving the first preliminary hard information of this naturelast Tuesday morning at 9 A.M., I directed that our surveillance be steppedup. And having now confirmed and completed our evaluation of the evidence and our decisionon a course of action, this Government feels obliged to report this newcrisis to you in fullest detail.The characteristics of these new missile sites indicate two distincttypes of installations. Several of them include medium range ballisticmissiles, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead for a distance of more than 1,000 nautical miles. Eachof these missiles, in short, is capable of striking Washington, D. C.,the Panama Canal, Cape Canaveral, Mexico City, or any other city in the southeastern partof the United States, in Central America, or in the Caribbean area.  Click photo for high resolution  Additional sites not yet completed appear to be designed for intermediaterange ballistic missiles -- capable of traveling more than twice as far-- and thus capable of striking most of the major cities in the Western Hemisphere, rangingas far north as Hudson Bay, Canada, and as far south as Lima, Peru. Inaddition, jet bombers, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, are now being uncrated and assembledin Cuba, while the necessary air bases are being prepared.  This urgent transformation of Cuba into an important strategic base-- by the presence of these large, long-range, and clearly offensive weaponsof sudden mass destruction -- constitutes an explicit threat to the peace and securityof all the Americas, in flagrant and deliberate defiance of the Rio Pactof 1947, the traditions of this nation and hemisphere, the joint resolutionof the 87th Congress, the Charter of the United Nations, and my own publicwarnings to the Soviets on September 4 and 13. This action also contradictsthe repeated assurances of Soviet spokesmen, both publicly and privately delivered, that the arms buildup in Cuba would retain its original defensivecharacter, and that the Soviet Union had no need or desire to station strategicmissiles. on the territory of any other nation.  The size of this undertaking makes clear that it has been planned forsome months. Yet, only last month, after I had made clear the distinctionbetween any introduction of ground-to-ground missiles and the existenceof defensive antiaircraft missiles, the Soviet Government publicly statedon September 11 that, and I quote, ""the armaments and military equipmentsent to Cuba are designed exclusively for defensive purposes,"" that thereis, and I quote the Soviet Government, ""there is no need for the SovietGovernment to shift its weapons for a retaliatory blow to any other country,for instance Cuba,"" and that, and I quote their government, ""the SovietUnion has so powerful rockets to carry these nuclear warheads that thereis no need to search for sites for them beyond the boundaries of the SovietUnion.""That statement was false. Only last Thursday, as evidence of this rapid offensive buildup wasalready in my hand, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko told me in my officethat he was instructed to make it clear once again, as he said his governmenthad already done, that Soviet assistance to Cuba, and I quote, ""pursuedsolely the purpose of contributing to the defense capabilities of Cuba,""that, and I quote him, ""training by Soviet specialists of Cuban nationalsin handling defensive armaments was by no means offensive, and if it wereotherwise,"" Mr. Gromyko went on, ""the Soviet Government would never becomeinvolved in rendering such assistance.""That statement also was false.  Neither the United States of America nor the world community of nationscan tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part ofany nation, large or small. We no longer live in a world where only the actual firing ofweapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation's security to constitutemaximum peril. Nuclear weapons are so destructive and ballistic missiles are so swift, thatany substantially increased possibility of their use or any sudden changein their deployment may well be regarded as a definite threat to peace.  For many years, both the Soviet Union and the United States, recognizingthis fact, have deployed strategic nuclear weapons with great care, neverupsetting the precarious status quo which insured that these weapons would not beused in the absence of some vital challenge. Our own strategic missileshave never been transferred to the territory of any other nation under a cloak of secrecyand deception; and our history -- unlike that of the Soviets since theend of World War II -- demonstrates that we have no desire to dominate or conquer any othernation or impose our system upon its people. Nevertheless, American citizenshave become adjusted to living daily on the bull's-eye of Soviet missiles locatedinside the U.S.S.R. or in submarines.In that sense, missiles in Cuba add to an already clear and presentdanger -- although it should be noted the nations of Latin America havenever previously been subjected to a potential nuclear threat. But this secret, swift, extraordinary buildup of Communist missiles-- in an area well known to have a special and historical relationshipto the United States and the nations of the Western Hemisphere, in violationof Soviet assurances, and in defiance of American and hemispheric policy-- this sudden, clandestine decision to station strategic weapons for thefirst time outside of Soviet soil -- is a deliberately provocative andunjustified change in the status quo which cannot be accepted by this country,if our courage and our commitments are ever to be trusted again by eitherfriend or foe.The 1930's taught us a clear lesson: aggressive conduct, if allowedto go unchecked and unchallenged, ultimately leads to war. This nationis opposed to war. We are also true to our word. Our unswerving objective,therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this orany other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from theWestern Hemisphere. Our policy has been one of patience and restraint, as befits a peacefuland powerful nation which leads a worldwide alliance. We have been determinednot to be diverted from our central concerns by mere irritants and fanatics.But now further action is required, and it is under way; and these actionsmay only be the beginning. We will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk the costs of worldwidenuclear war in which even the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouth;but neither will we shrink from that risk at any time it must be faced.Acting, therefore, in the defense of our own security and of the entireWestern Hemisphere, and under the authority entrusted to me by the Constitutionas endorsed by the Resolution of the Congress, I have directed that thefollowing initial steps be taken immediately: First: To halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensivemilitary equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All shipsof any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if foundto contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantinewill be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. We arenot at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Sovietsattempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948.  Second: I have directed the continued and increased close surveillanceof Cuba and its military buildup. The foreign ministers of the OAS [Organizationof American States], in their communiqu&eacute;' of October 6, rejectedsecrecy on such matters in this hemisphere. Should these offensive militarypreparations continue, thus increasing the threat to the hemisphere, furtheraction will be justified. I have directed the Armed Forces to prepare forany eventualities; and I trust that in the interest of both the Cuban peopleand the Soviet technicians at the sites, the hazards to all concerned ofcontinuing this threat will be recognized.Third: It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missilelaunched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attackby the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response uponthe Soviet Union.Fourth: As a necessary military precaution, I have reinforced our baseat Guantanamo, evacuated today the dependents of our personnel there, andordered additional military units to be on a standby alert basis.  Fifth: We are calling tonight for an immediate meeting of the Organ[ization]of Consultation under the Organization of American States, to considerthis threat to hemispheric security and to invoke articles 6 and 8 of theRio Treaty in support of all necessary action. The United Nations Charterallows for regional security arrangements, and the nations of this hemispheredecided long ago against the military presence of outside powers. Our otherallies around the world have also been alerted.  Sixth: Under the Charter of the United Nations, we are asking tonightthat an emergency meeting of the Security Council be convoked without delayto take action against this latest Soviet threat to world peace. Our resolution willcall for the prompt dismantling and withdrawal of all offensive weaponsin Cuba, under the supervision of U.N. observers, before the quarantinecan be lifted.Seventh and finally:I call upon Chairman Khrushchev to halt andeliminate this clandestine, reckless, and provocative threat to world peaceand to stable relations between our two nations. I call upon him further to abandon this courseof world domination, and to join in an historic effort to end the perilousarms race and to transform the history of man. He has an opportunity now to move theworld back from the abyss of destruction by returning to his government'sown words that it had no need to station missiles outside its own territory,and withdrawing these weapons from Cuba by refraining from any action whichwill widen or deepen the present crisis, and then by participating in asearch for peaceful and permanent solutions.  This nation is prepared to present its case against the Soviet threatto peace, and our own proposals for a peaceful world, at any time and inany forum -- in the OAS, in the United Nations, or in any other meetingthat could be useful -- without limiting our freedom of action. We havein the past made strenuous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.We have proposed the elimination of all arms and military bases in a fairand effective disarmament treaty. We are prepared to discuss new proposalsfor the removal of tensions on both sides, including the possibilitiesof a genuinely independent Cuba, free to determine its own destiny. Wehave no wish to war with the Soviet Union -- for we are a peaceful peoplewho desire to live in peace with all other peoples.  But it is difficult to settle or even discuss these problems in an atmosphereof intimidation. That is why this latest Soviet threat -- or any otherthreat which is made either independently or in response to our actionsthis week-- must and will be met with determination. Any hostile move anywherein the world against the safety and freedom of peoples to whom we are committed,including in particular the brave people of West Berlin, will be met bywhatever action is needed.Finally, I want to say a few words to the captive people of Cuba, towhom this speech is being directly carried by special radio facilities.I speak to you as a friend, as one who knows of your deep attachment toyour fatherland, as one who shares your aspirations for liberty and justicefor all. And I have watched and the American people have watched with deepsorrow how your nationalist revolution was betrayed -- and how your fatherlandfell under foreign domination. Now your leaders are no longer Cuban leadersinspired by Cuban ideals. They are puppets and agents of an internationalconspiracy which has turned Cuba against your friends and neighbors inthe Americas, and turned it into the first Latin American country to becomea target for nuclear war -- the first Latin American country to have theseweapons on its soil.These new weapons are not in your interest. They contribute nothingto your peace and well-being. They can only undermine it. But this countryhas no wish to cause you to suffer or to impose any system upon you. We know that your livesand land are being used as pawns by those who deny your freedom. Many timesin the past, the Cuban people have risen to throw out tyrants who destroyedtheir liberty. And I have no doubt that most Cubans today look forwardto the time when they will be truly free -- free from foreign domination,free to choose their own leaders, free to select their own system, freeto own their own land, free to speak and write and worship without fearor degradation. And then shall Cuba be welcomed back to the society offree nations and to the associations of this hemisphere.  My fellow citizens, let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerouseffort on which we have set out. No one can foresee precisely what courseit will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred. Many monthsof sacrifice and self-discipline lie ahead -- months in which both ourpatience and our will will be tested,months in which many threatsand denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers. But the greatest dangerof all would be to do nothing.The path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards, as all pathsare; but it is the one most consistent with our character and courage asa nation and our commitments around the world. The cost of freedom is always high, butAmericans have always paid it. And one path we shall never choose, andthat is the path of surrender or submission.  Our goal is not the victory of might, but the vindication of right;not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom, here inthis hemisphere, and, we hope, around the world. God willing, that goalwill be achieved.Thank you and good night. Robert McNamara Bottom-Lines the Cuban Missile Crisis from CONELRAD on Vimeo.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,46," Spiro Agnew -- Television News Coverage (Nov 13, 1969)Spiro Theodore AgnewTelevision News Coverage  delivered 13 November 1969, Des Moines, Iowa Plug-in required for flash audiovar so = new );  "", ""spiroagnewtvnewsgo2."");   ;   for flash[  fromaudio]Thank you very much,Governor Ray, Governor Ogilvie,Governor Tiemann, Mr. Boyd, Miss Peterson, the many distinguished officials of the Republican Party gathered for this Midwest regional meeting. It's indeed a pleasure for me to be here tonight. I had intended to make all three of the regional meetings that have been scheduled thus far, but unfortunately I had to scrub the Western one -- Hawaii was a little far at the moment, that time. But I'm glad to be here tonight and I look forward to attending the others.I think it's obvious from the cameras here that I didn't come to discuss the ban oncyclamates or DDT. I have a subject I think is of great interest to the American people. Tonight I want to discuss the importance of thetelevision medium to the American people. No nation depends more on the intelligentjudgment of its citizens. And no medium has a more profound influence over public opinion.Nowhere in our system are there fewer checks on such vast power. So nowhere should there bemore conscientious responsibility exercised than by the news media. The question is, Arewe demanding enough of our television news presentations? And are the men of this mediumdemanding enough of themselves?Monday night, a week ago,President Nixon  delivered the mostimportant address of his Administration, one of the most important of our decade. Hissubject was Vietnam. My hope, as his at that time, was to rally the American people to see the conflict throughto a lasting and just peace in the Pacific. For 32 minutes, he reasoned with a nation thathas suffered almost a third of a million casualties in the longest war in its history.When the President completed his address -- an address, incidentally,that he spent weeks in the preparation of -- his words and policies were subjected toinstant analysis and querulous criticism. The audience of 70 million Americans gathered tohear the President of the United States was inherited by a small band of networkcommentators and self-appointed analysts, the majority of whom expressed in one way oranother their hostility to what he had to say.It was obvious that their minds were made up in advance. Those whorecall the fumbling and groping that followed President Johnson's dramatic disclosureof his intention not to seek another term have seen these men in a genuine state of non-preparedness. This was not it.One commentator -- One commentator twice contradicted the President's statementabout the exchange of correspondence withHo Chi Minh. Another challenged thePresident's abilities as a politician. A third asserted that the President wasfollowing a Pentagon line. Others, by the expressions on their faces, the tone of theirquestions, and the sarcasm of their responses, made clear their sharp disapproval.To guarantee in advance that the President's plea for national unity would be challenged, one network [A.B.C.] trotted outAverell Harriman for the occasion.Throughout the President's address, he waited in the wings. When the President concluded,Mr. Harriman recited perfectly. He attacked theThieu Government as unrepresentative. Hecriticized the President's speech for various deficiencies. He twice issued a call tothe Senate Foreign Relations Committee to debate Vietnam once again. He stated his beliefthat the Vietcong or North Vietnamese did not really want a military takeover of SouthVietnam. And he told a little anecdote about a very, very responsible fellowhe had met in the North Vietnamese delegation.1All in all, Mr. Harriman offered a broad range of gratuitous advicechallenging and contradicting the policies outlined by the President of the United States.Where the President had issued a call for unity, Mr. Harriman was encouraging the countrynot to listen to him.A word about Mr. Harriman. For 10 months he was America's chiefnegotiator at theParis peace talks -- a period in which the United States swapped some ofthe greatest military concessions in the history of warfare for an enemy agreement on theshape of the bargaining table. Like Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, Mr. Harriman seemsto be under some heavy compulsion to justify his failures to anyone who will listen. Andthe networks have shown themselves willing to give him all the air time he desires.Now every American has a right to disagree with the President of theUnited States and to express publicly that disagreement. But the President of the UnitedStates has a right to communicate directly with the people who elected him, and the -- and the peopleof this country have the right to make up their own minds and form their own opinions abouta Presidential address without having the President's words and thoughts characterizedthrough the prejudices of hostile critics before they can even be digested.When Winston Churchill rallied public opinion to stay the courseagainst Hitler's Germany, he didn't have to contend with a gaggle ofcommentators raising doubts about whether he was reading public opinion right, or whetherBritain had the stamina to see the world -- the war through. When President Kennedy rallied a nationin the Cuban missile crisis, his address to the people was not chewed over by a roundtableof critics who disparaged the course of action he'd asked America to follow.The purpose of my remarks tonight is to focus your attention on thislittle group of men who not only enjoy a right of instant rebuttal to every Presidentialaddress, but, more importantly, wield a free hand in selecting, presenting, andinterpreting the great issues in our nation. First, let's define that power.At least 40 million Americans every night, it's estimated,watch the network news. Seven million of them view A.B.C., the remainder being dividedbetween N.B.C. and C.B.S. According to Harris polls and other studies, for millions ofAmericans the networks are the sole source of national and world news. In WillRogers' observation, what you knew was what you read in the newspaper. Today forgrowing millions of Americans, it's what they see and hear on their television sets.Now how is this network news determined? A small group of men,numbering perhaps no more than a dozen anchormen, commentators, and executive producers,settle upon the 20 minutes or so of film and commentary that's to reach the public.This selection is made from the 90 to 180 minutes that may be available. Their powers ofchoice are broad. They decide what 40 to 50 million Americans will learn of theday's events in the nation and in the world. We cannot measure this power andinfluence by the traditional democratic standards, for these men can create nationalissues overnight. They can make or break by their coverage and commentary a moratorium onthe war. They can elevate men from obscurity to national prominence within a week. Theycan reward some politicians with national exposure and ignore others.For millions of Americans the network reporter who covers acontinuing issue -- like the ABM or civil rights -- becomes, in effect, the presiding judgein a national trial by jury.It must be recognized that the networks have made importantcontributions to the national knowledge -- through news, documentaries, and specials. They haveoften used their power constructively and creatively to awaken the public conscience tocritical problems. The networks made hunger and black lung disease national issuesovernight. The TV networks have done what no other medium could have done in terms ofdramatizing the horrors of war. The networks have tackled our most difficult socialproblems with a directness and an immediacy that's the gift of their medium. Theyfocus the nation's attention on its environmental abuses -- on pollution in the GreatLakes and the threatened ecology of the Everglades. But it was also the networks thatelevated Stokely Carmichael and George Lincoln Rockwell from obscurity to nationalprominence.Nor is their power confined to the substantive. A raised eyebrow,an inflection of the voice, a caustic remark dropped in the middle of a broadcast canraise doubts in a million minds about the veracity of a public official or the wisdom of aGovernment policy. One Federal Communications Commissioner considers the powers of thenetworks equal to that of local, state, and Federal Governments all combined. Certainly itrepresents a concentration of -- of power over American public opinion unknown in history.Now what do Americans know of the men who wield this power? Of themen who produce and direct the network news, the nation knows practically nothing. Of thecommentators, most Americans know little other than that they reflect an urbane andassured presence, seemingly well-informed on every important matter. We do know that to aman these commentators and producers live and work in the geographical and intellectualconfines of Washington, D.C., or New York City, the latter of which James Reston terms themost unrepresentative community in the entire United States.Both communities bask in their own provincialism, their ownparochialism. We can deduce that these men read the same newspapers. They drawtheir political and social views from the same sources. Worse, they talk constantly to oneanother, thereby providing artificial reinforcement to their shared viewpoints. Do theyallow their biases to influence the selection and presentation of the news? David Brinkleystates, objectivity is impossible to normal human behavior. Rather, he says, we shouldstrive for fairness (p. 219).2Another anchorman on a network news show contends, and I quote: You can't expunge all your private convictions just because you sit in a seat like this and a camera starts to stare at you. I think your program has to reflect what your basic feelings are. I'll plead guilty to that.3Less than a week before the 1968 election, this same commentatorcharged that President Nixon's campaign commitments were no more durable thancampaign balloons. He claimed that, were it not for the fear of the hostile reaction, RichardNixon would be giving into, and I quote him exactly, his natural instinct to smash the enemy with a club or go after him with a meat axe.4Had this slander been made by one political candidate about another,it would have been dismissed by most commentators as a partisan attack. But this attackemanated from the privileged sanctuary of a network studio and therefore had the apparentdignity of an objective statement.The American people would rightly not tolerate thisconcentration of power in Government. Is it not fair and relevant to question its concentration in thehands of a tiny, enclosed fraternity of privileged men elected by no one and enjoying amonopoly sanctioned and licensed by Government? The views of a -- the majority of this fraternity donot -- and I repeat,not -- represent the views of America. And that is why such a great gulf existed between how thenation received the President's address and how the networks reviewed it.Not onlydid the country receive the President's address warmer -- more warmly than the networks, but soalso did the Congress of the United States. Yesterday, the President was notified that 300 individualCongressmen and 50 Senators of both parties had endorsed his efforts for peace. As withother American institutions, perhaps it is time that the networks were made moreresponsive to the views of the nation and more responsible to the people they serve.Now I want to make myself perfectly clear: I'm not asking forGovernment censorship or any other kind of censorship. I am asking whether a form ofcensorship already exists when the news that 40 million Americans -- when the news that 40 million Americans receive each night isdetermined by a handful of men responsible only to their corporate employers and isfiltered through a handful of commentators who admit to their own set of biases.The questions I'm raising here tonight should have been raisedby others long ago. They should have been raised by those Americans who have traditionallyconsidered the preservation of freedom of speech and freedom of the press their specialprovinces of responsibility. They -- They should have been raised by those Americans who share theview of the late Justice Learned Hand that right conclusions are more likely to begathered out of a multitude of tongues than through any kind of authoritativeselection.5Advocates for the networks have claimed a First Amendment right to the same unlimited freedoms held by the great newspapers of America. But the situations are not identical. Where The New York Timesreaches 800,000 people, N.B.C. reaches 20 times that number on its evening news. Nor can the tremendous impact of seeing television film andhearing commentary be compared with reading the printed page.A decade ago, before the network news acquired such dominance overpublic opinion, Walter Lippman spoke to the issue. He said, There [is] is an essential and radical difference between television and printing...The three or four competing televisionstations control virtually all that can be received over the air by ordinary televisionsets. But besides the mass circulation dailies, there are [the] weeklies, [the] monthlies, [the] out-of-townnewspapers and books. If a man does [not] like his newspaper, he can read another fromout of town, or wait for a weekly news magazine. It [is] not ideal, but it [is]infinitely better than the situation in television. There, if a man does [not] like what the networks [offer him], all he can do is [to] turn them off, and listen to a phonograph (p.414).6Networks, he stated, which are few innumber, have a virtual monopoly of a whole medium of communication. The newspapers of masscirculation have no monopoly [of] the medium of print (p.414).7Now a virtual monopoly of a whole medium of communication is notsomething that democratic people should blithely ignore. And we are not going to cut offour television sets and listen to the phonograph just because the airways belong to thenetworks. They don't. They belong to the people. As Justice Byron...White wrote in hislandmark opinion six months ago, It [is] the right of the viewers and listeners, not theright of the broadcasters, which is paramount.8Now it's argued that this power presents no danger in the handsof those who have used it responsibly. But as to whether or not the networks have abusedthe power they enjoy, let us call as our first witness, former Vice President Humphrey and the city of Chicago. According toTheodore White, television's intercutting of the film from the streets of Chicago with the current proceedings on the floor of the convention created the most striking and false political picture of 1968 -- the nomination of a man for the American Presidency by the brutality and violence of merciless police.9If we are to believe a recent report of the House of RepresentativesCommerce Committee, then television's presentation of the violence in the streetsworked an injustice on the reputation of the Chicago police. According to the committeefindings, one network in particular presented, and I quote, a one-sided picturewhich in large measure exonerates the demonstrators and protestors.10 Film ofprovocations of police that was available never saw the light of day, while the film of apolice response which the protestors provoked was shown to millions.Another network showed virtually the same scene of violence fromthree separate angles without making clear it was the same scene. And while the fullreport is reticent in drawing conclusions, it is not a document to inspire confidence inthe fairness of the network news. Our knowledge of the impact of network news on thenational mind is far from incomplete [sic] but some early returns are available. Again, we haveenough information to raise serious questions about its effect on a democratic society.Several years ago Fred Friendly, one of the pioneers of network news, wrote that itsmissing ingredients were conviction, controversy, and a point of view (p.153).11 The networks havecompensated with a vengeance.And in the networks' endless pursuit of controversy, we shouldask: What is the end value -- to enlighten or to profit? What is the end result -- to informor to confuse? How does the ongoing exploration for more action, more excitement, moredrama serve our national search for internal peace and stability?Gresham's Law seemsto be operating in the network news. Bad news drives out good news. The irrational is morecontroversial than the rational. Concurrence can no longer compete with dissent. One minute of Eldridge Cleaver is worth 10 minutes of Roy Wilkins.The labor crisis settled at the negotiating table is nothing compared to the confrontationthat results in a strike -- or better yet, violence along the picket lines. Normality has become the nemesis of the network news. Now the upshot of all this controversy is that a narrow and distorted picture of America often emerges from the televised news. A single, dramatic piece of the mosaic becomes in the minds ofmillions the entire picture. The -- The American who relies upon television for his newsmight conclude that the majority of American students are embittered radicals; that themajority of black Americans feel no regard for their country; that violence andlawlessness are the rule rather than the exception on the American campus. We know that none of these conclusions is true.Perhaps the place to start looking for a credibility gap is not in theoffices of the Government in Washington but in the studios of the networks in NewYork. Television may have destroyed the old stereotypes, but has it not created new ones intheir places? What has this passionate pursuit of controversy done to the politics ofprogress through local compromise essential to the functioning of a democratic society?The members of Congress or the Senate who follow their principlesand philosophy quietly in a spirit of compromise are unknown to many Americans, while theloudest and most extreme dissenters on every issue are known to every man in thestreet. How many marches and demonstrations would we have if the marchers did not know thatthe ever-faithful TV cameras would be there to record their antics for the next news show?We've heard demands that Senators and Congressmen and judgesmake known all their financial connections so that the public will know who and whatinfluences their decisions and their votes. Strong arguments can be made for that view.But when a single commentator or producer, night after night, determines for millions ofpeople how much of each side of a great issue they are going to see and hear, should henot first disclose his personal views on the issue as well? In this search for excitement and controversy, has more than equaltime gone to the minority of Americans who specialize in attacking the United States -- itsinstitutions and its citizens?Tonight I've raised questions. I've made no attempt tosuggest the answers. The answers must come from the media men. They are challenged to turntheir critical powers on themselves, to direct their energy, their talent, and theirconviction toward improving the quality and objectivity of news presentation. They arechallenged to structure their own civic ethics -- to relate their great feeling with the great responsibilitiesthey hold.And the people of America are challenged, too -- challenged to pressfor responsible news presentations. The people can let the networks know that they wanttheir news straight and objective. The people can register their complaints on biasthrough mail to the networks and phone calls to local stations. This is one case where thepeople must defend themselves, where the citizen, not the Government, must be thereformer; where the consumer can be the most effective crusader.By way of conclusion, let me say that every elected leader in theUnited States depends on these men of the media. Whether what I've said to youtonight will be heard and seen at all by the nation is not my decision; it's not yourdecision -- it's their decision.Intomorrow's edition of the Des Moines Register,you'll be able to read a news story detailing what I said tonight. Editorialcomment will be reserved for the editorial page, where it belongs. Should not the samewall of separation exist between news and comment on the nation's networks? Now my friends, we'd never trust such power, as I'vedescribed, over public opinion in the hands of an elected Government. It's time wequestioned it in the hands of a small and unelected elite. The great networks have dominatedAmerica's airwaves for decades. The people are entitled to a full accounting of theirstewardship.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,47," Jesse Jackson -- 1988 Democratic National Convention AddressJesse Jackson1988 Democratic National Convention Address delivered 19 July 1988, Omni Coliseum, Atlanta GAVideo Purchase  Off-Site .1Off-Site .2]Tonight, we pause and give praise and honor to God for being good enough to allow us to be at this place at this time. When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America: Red, Yellow, Brown, Black and White. We're all precious in God's sight -- the real rainbow coalition.All of us -- All of us who are here think that we are seated. But we're really standing on someone's shoulders. Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Rosa Parks -- the mother of the civil rights movement.[Mrs. Rosa Parks is brought to the podium.]I want to express my deep love and appreciation for the support my family has given me over these past months. They have endured pain, anxiety, threat, and fear. But they have been strengthened and made secure by our faith in God, in America, and in you. Your love has protected us and made us strong. To my wife Jackie, the foundation of our family; to our five children whom you met tonight; to my mother, Mrs. Helen Jackson, who is present tonight; and to our grandmother, Mrs. Matilda Burns; to my brother Chuck and his family; to my mother-in-law, Mrs. Gertrude Brown, who just last month at age 61 graduated from Hampton Institute -- a marvelous achievement.I offer my appreciation to Mayor Andrew Young who has provided such gracious hospitality to all of us this week.And a special salute to President Jimmy Carter. President Carter restored honor to the White House after Watergate. He gave many of us a special opportunity to grow. For his kind words, for his unwavering commitment to peace in the world, and for the voters that came from his family, every member of his family, led by Billy and Amy, I offer my special thanks to the Carter family.My right and my privilege to stand here before you has been won, won in my lifetime, by the blood and the sweat of the innocent.Twenty-four years ago, the late Fannie Lou Hamer and Aaron Henry -- who sits here tonight from Mississippi -- were locked out onto the streets in Atlantic City; the head of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.But tonight, a Black and White delegation from Mississippi is headed by Ed Cole, a Black man from Mississippi; twenty-four years later.Many were lost in the struggle for the right to vote: Jimmy Lee Jackson, a young student, gave his life; Viola Liuzzo, a White mother from Detroit, called nigger lover, and brains blown out at point blank range; [Michael] Schwerner, [Andrew] Goodman and [James] Chaney -- two Jews and a Black -- found in a common grave, bodies riddled with bullets in Mississippi; the four darling little girls in a church in Birmingham, Alabama. They died that we might have a right to live.Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lies only a few miles from us tonight. Tonight he must feel good as he looks down upon us. We sit here together, a rainbow, a coalition -- the sons and daughters of slavemasters and the sons and daughters of slaves, sitting together around a common table, to decide the direction of our party and our country. His heart would be full tonight.As a testament to the struggles of those who have gone before; as a legacy for those who will come after; as a tribute to the endurance, the patience, the courage of our forefathers and mothers; as an assurance that their prayers are being answered, that their work has not been in vain, and, that hope is eternal, tomorrow night my name will go into nomination for the Presidency of the United States of America.We meet tonight at the crossroads, a point of decision. Shall we expand, be inclusive, find unity and power; or suffer division and impotence?We've come to Atlanta, the cradle of the Old South, the crucible of the New South. Tonight, there is a sense of celebration, because we are moved, fundamentally moved from racial battlegrounds by law, to economic common ground. Tomorrow we'll challenge to move to higher groundmon ground. Think of Jerusalem, the intersection where many trails met. A small village that became the birthplace for three great religions -- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Why was this village so blessed? Because it provided a crossroads where different people met, different cultures, different civilizations could meet and find common ground. When people come together, flowers always flourish -- the air is rich with the aroma of a new spring.Take New York, the dynamic metropolis. What makes New York so special? It's the invitation at the Statue of Liberty, Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses who yearn to breathe free. Not restricted to English only. Many people, many cultures, many languages with one thing in common: They yearn to breathe free. Common ground.Tonight in Atlanta, for the first time in this century, we convene in the South; a state where Governors once stood in school house doors; where Julian Bond was denied a seat in the State Legislature because of his conscientious objection to the Vietnam War; a city that, through its five Black Universities, has graduated more black students than any city in the world.  Atlanta, now a modern intersection of the New Southmon ground. That's the challenge of our party tonight -- left wing, right wing.Progress will not come through boundless liberalism nor static conservatism, but at the critical mass of mutual survival -- not at boundless liberalism nor static conservatism, but at the critical mass of mutual survival. It takes two wings to fly. Whether you're a hawk or a dove, you're just a bird living in the same environment, in the same world.The Bible teaches that when lions and lambs lie down together, none will be afraid, and there will be peace in the valley. It sounds impossible. Lions eat lambs. Lambs sensibly flee from lions. Yet even lions and lambs find common ground. Why? Because neither lions nor lambs want the forest to catch on fire. Neither lions nor lambs want acid rain to fall. Neither lions nor lambs can survive nuclear war. If lions and lambs can find common ground, surely we can as well -- as civilized people.The only time that we win is when we come together. In 1960, John Kennedy, the late John Kennedy, beat Richard Nixon by only 112,000 votes -- less than one vote per precinct. He won by the margin of our hope. He brought us together. He reached out. He had the courage to defy his advisors and inquire about Dr. King's jailing in Albany, Georgia. We won by the margin of our hope, inspired by courageous leadership. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson brought both wings together -- the thesis, the antithesis, and the creative synthesis -- and together we won. In 1976, Jimmy Carter unified us again, and we won. When do we not come together, we never win. In 1968, the division and despair in July led to our defeat in November. In 1980, rancor in the spring and the summer led to Reagan in the fall. When we divide, we cannot win. We must find common ground as the basis for survival and development and change and growth.Today when we debated, differed, deliberated, agreed to agree, agreed to disagree, when we had the good judgment to argue a case and then not self-destruct, George Bush was just a little further away from the White House and a little closer to private life.Tonight, I salute Governor Michael Dukakis. He has run -- He has run a well-managed and a dignified campaign. No matter how tired or how tried, he always resisted the temptation to stoop to demagoguery.I've watched a good mind fast at work, with steel nerves, guiding his campaign out of the crowded field without appeal to the worst in us. I've watched his perspective grow as his environment has expanded. I've seen his toughness and tenacity close up. I know his commitment to public service. Mike Dukakis' parents were a doctor and a teacher; my parents a maid, a beautician, and a janitor. There's a great gap between Brookline, Massachusetts and Haney Street in the Fieldcrest Village housing projects in Greenville, South Carolina.He studied law; I studied theology. There are differences of religion, region, and race; differences in experiences and perspectives. But the genius of America is that out of the many we become one.Providence has enabled our paths to intersect. His foreparents came to America on immigrant ships; my foreparents came to America on slave ships. But whatever the original ships, we're in the same boat tonight.Our ships could pass in the night -- if we have a false sense of independence -- or they could collide and crash. We would lose our passengers. We can seek a high reality and a greater good. Apart, we can drift on the broken pieces of Reagonomics, satisfy our baser instincts, and exploit the fears of our people. At our highest, we can call upon noble instincts and navigate this vessel to safety. The greater good is the common good.As Jesus said, Not My will, but Thine be done. It was his way of saying there's a higher good beyond personal comfort or position.The good of our Nation is at stake. It's commitment to working men and women, to the poor and the vulnerable, to the many in the world.With so many guided missiles, and so much misguided leadership, the stakes are exceedingly high. Our choice? Full participation in a democratic government, or more abandonment and neglect. And so this night, we choose not a false sense of independence, not our capacity to survive and endure. Tonight we choose interdependency, and our capacity to act and unite for the greater goodmon good is finding commitment to new priorities to expansion and inclusion. A commitment to expanded participation in the Democratic Party at every level. A commitment to a shared national campaign strategy and involvement at every level.A commitment to new priorities that insure that hope will be kept alive. A common ground commitment to a legislative agenda for empowerment, for the John Conyers bill -- universal, on-site, same-day registration everywhere. A commitment to D.C. statehood and empowerment -- D.C. deserves statehood. A commitment to economic set-asides, commitment to the Dellums bill for comprehensive sanctions against South Africa. A shared commitment to a common directionmon ground.Easier said than done. Where do you find common ground? At the point of challenge. This campaign has shown that politics need not be marketed by politicians, packaged by pollsters and pundits. Politics can be a moral arena where people come together to find common ground.We find common ground at the plant gate that closes on workers without notice. We find common ground at the farm auction, where a good farmer loses his or her land to bad loans or diminishing markets. Common ground at the school yard where teachers cannot get adequate pay, and students cannot get a scholarship, and can't make a loan. Common ground at the hospital admitting room, where somebody tonight is dying because they cannot afford to go upstairs to a bed that's empty waiting for someone with insurance to get sick. We are a better nation than that. We must do bettermon ground. What is leadership if not present help in a time of crisis? And so I met you at the point of challenge. In Jay, Maine, where paper workers were striking for fair wages; in Greenville, Iowa, where family farmers struggle for a fair price; in Cleveland, Ohio, where working women seek comparable worth; in McFarland, California, where the children of Hispanic farm workers may be dying from poisoned land, dying in clusters with cancer; in an AIDS hospice in Houston, Texas, where the sick support one another, too often rejected by their own parents and friendsmon ground. America is not a blanket woven from one thread, one color, one cloth. When I was a child growing up in Greenville, South Carolina and grandmamma could not afford a blanket, she didn't complain and we did not freeze. Instead she took pieces of old cloth -- patches, wool, silk, gabardine, crockersack -- only patches, barely good enough to wipe off your shoes with. But they didn't stay that way very long. With sturdy hands and a strong cord, she sewed them together into a quilt, a thing of beauty and power and culture. Now, Democrats, we must build such a quilt. Farmers, you seek fair prices and you are right -- but you cannot stand alone. Your patch is not big enough.Workers, you fight for fair wages, you are right -- but your patch labor is not big enough.Women, you seek comparable worth and pay equity, you are right -- but your patch is not big enough.Women, mothers, who seek Head Start, and day care and prenatal care on the front side of life, relevant jail care and welfare on the back side of life, you are right -- but your patch is not big enough.Students, you seek scholarships, you are right -- but your patch is not big enough.Blacks and Hispanics, when we fight for civil rights, we are right -- but our patch is not big enough.Gays and lesbians, when you fight against discrimination and a cure for AIDS, you are right -- but your patch is not big enough.Conservatives and progressives, when you fight for what you believe, right wing, left wing, hawk, dove, you are right from your point of view, but your point of view is not enough.But don't despair. Be as wise as my grandmamma. Pull the patches and the pieces together, bound by a common thread. When we form a great quilt of unity and common ground, we'll have the power to bring about health care and housing and jobs and education and hope to our Nation.We, the people, can win.We stand at the end of a long dark night of reaction. We stand tonight united in the commitment to a new direction. For almost eight years we've been led by those who view social good coming from private interest, who view public life as a means to increase private wealth. They have been prepared to sacrifice the common good of the many to satisfy the private interests and the wealth of a few.We believe in a government that's a tool of our democracy in service to the public, not an instrument of the aristocracy in search of private wealth. We believe in government with the consent of the governed, of, for and by the people. We must now emerge into a new day with a new direction.Reaganomics: Based on the belief that the rich had too much money [sic] -- too little money and the poor had too much. That's classic Reaganomics. They believe that the poor had too much money and the rich had too little money,- so they engaged in reverse Robin Hood - took from the poor, gave to the rich, paid for by the middle class. We cannot stand four more years of Reaganomics in any version, in any disguise.How do I document that case? Seven years later, the richest 1 percent of our society pays 20 percent less in taxes. The poorest 10 percent pay 20 percent more: Reaganomics.Reagan gave the rich and the powerful a multibillion-dollar party. Now the party is over. He expects the people to pay for the damage. I take this principal position, convention, let us not raise taxes on the poor and the middle-class, but those who had the party, the rich and the powerful, must pay for the party.I just want to take common sense to high places. We're spending one hundred and fifty billion dollars a year defending Europe and Japan 43 years after the war is over. We have more troops in Europe tonight than we had seven years ago. Yet the threat of war is ever more remote.Germany and Japan are now creditor nations; that means they've got a surplus. We are a debtor nation -- means we are in debt. Let them share more of the burden of their own defense. Use some of that money to build decent housing. Use some of that money to educate our children. Use some of that money for long-term health care. Use some of that money to wipe out these slums and put America back to work!I just want to take common sense to high places. If we can bail out Europe and Japan; if we can bail out Continental Bank and Chrysler -- and Mr. Iacocca, make [sic] 8,000 dollars an hour -- we can bail out the family farmer.I just want to make common sense. It does not make sense to close down six hundred and fifty thousand family farms in this country while importing food from abroad subsidized by the U.S. Government. Let's make sense.It does not make sense to be escorting all our tankers up and down the Persian Gulf paying $2.50 for every one dollar worth of oil we bring out, while oil wells are capped in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. I just want to make sense.Leadership must meet the moral challenge of its day. What's the moral challenge of our day? We have public accommodations. We have the right to vote. We have open housing. What's the fundamental challenge of our day? It is to end economic violence. Plant closings without notice -- economic violence. Even the greedy do not profit long from greed -- economic violence.Most poor people are not lazy. They are not black. They are not brown. They are mostly White and female and young. But whether White, Black or Brown, a hungry baby's belly turned inside out is the same color -- color it pain; color it hurt; color it agony.Most poor people are not on welfare. Some of them are illiterate and can't read the want-ad sections. And when they can, they can't find a job that matches the address. They work hard everyday.I know. I live amongst them. I'm one of them. I know they work. I'm a witness. They catch the early bus. They work every day.They raise other people's children. They work everyday.They clean the streets. They work everyday. They drive dangerous cabs. They work everyday. They change the beds you slept in in these hotels last night and can't get a union contract. They work everyday.No, no, they are not lazy! Someone must defend them because it's right, and they cannot speak for themselves. They work in hospitals. I know they do. They wipe the bodies of those who are sick with fever and pain. They empty their bedpans. They clean out their commodes. No job is beneath them, and yet when they get sick they cannot lie in the bed they made up every day. America, that is not right. We are a better Nation than that. We are a better Nation than that.We need a real war on drugs. You can't just say no. It's deeper than that. You can't just get a palm reader or an astrologer. It's more profound than that.We are spending a hundred and fifty billion dollars on drugs a year. We've gone from ignoring it to focusing on the children. Children cannot buy a hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of drugs a year; a few high-profile athletes -- athletes are not laundering a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year -- bankers are.I met the children in Watts, who, unfortunately, in their despair, their grapes of hope have become raisins of despair, and they're turning on each other and they're self-destructing. But I stayed with them all night long. I wanted to hear their case.They said, Jesse Jackson, as you challenge us to say no to drugs, you're right; and to not sell them, you're right; and not use these guns, you're right. (And by the way, the promise of CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act]; they displaced CETA -- they did not replace CETA.) We have neither jobs nor houses nor services nor training -- no way out. Some of us take drugs as anesthesia for our pain. Some take drugs as a way of pleasure, good short-term pleasure and long-term pain. Some sell drugs to make money. It's wrong, we know, but you need to know that we know. We can go and buy the drugs by the boxes at the port. If we can buy the drugs at the port, don't you believe the Federal government can stop it if they want to?They say, We don't have Saturday night specials anymore. They say, We buy AK47's and Uzi's, the latest make of weapons. We buy them across the along these boulevards.You cannot fight a war on drugs unless and until you're going to challenge the bankers and the gun sellers and those who grow them. Don't just focus on the children; let's stop drugs at the level of supply and demand. We must end the scourge on the American Culture.Leadership. What difference will we make? Leadership. Cannot just go along to get along. We must do more than change Presidents. We must change direction.Leadership must face the moral challenge of our day. The nuclear war build-up is irrational. Strong leadership cannot desire to look tough and let that stand in the way of the pursuit of peace. Leadership must reverse the arms race. At least we should pledge no first use. Why? Because first use begets first retaliation. And that's mutual annihilation. That's not a rational way out.No use at all. Let's think it out and not fight it our because it's an unwinnable fight. Why hold a card that you can never drop? Let's give peace a chance.Leadership. We now have this marvelous opportunity to have a breakthrough with the Soviets. Last year 200,000 Americans visited the Soviet Union. There's a chance for joint ventures into space -- not Star Wars and war arms escalation but a space defense initiative. Let's build in the space together and demilitarize the heavens. There's a way out.America, let us expand. When Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev met there was a big meeting. They represented together one-eighth of the human race. Seven-eighths of the human race was locked out of that room. Most people in the world tonight -- half are Asian, one-half of them are Chinese. There are 22 nations in the Middle East. There's Europe; 40 million Latin Americans next door to us; the Caribbean; Africa -- a half-billion people.Most people in the world today are Yellow or Brown or Black, non-Christian, poor, female, young and don't speak English in the real world.This generation must offer leadership to the real world. We're losing ground in Latin America, Middle East, South Africa because we're not focusing on the real world. That's the real world. We must use basic principles -- support international law. We stand the most to gain from it. Support human rights -- we believe in that. Support self-determination -- we're built on that. Support economic development -- you know it's right. Be consistent and gain our moral authority in the world. I challenge you tonight, my friends, let's be bigger and better as a Nation and as a Party.We have basic challenges -- freedom in South Africa. We've already agreed as Democrats to declare South Africa to be a terrorist state. But don't just stop there. Get South Africa out of Angola; free Namibia; support the front line states. We must have a new humane human rights consistent policy in Africa.I'm often asked, Jesse, why do you take on these tough issues? They're not very political. We can't win that way.If an issue is morally right, it will eventually be political. It may be political and never be right. Fannie Lou Hamer didn't have the most votes in Atlantic City, but her principles have outlasted every delegate who voted to lock her out. Rosa Parks did not have the most votes, but she was morally right. Dr. King didn't have the most votes about the Vietnam War, but he was morally right. If we are principled first, our politics will fall in place.Jesse, why do you take these big bold initiatives? A poem by an unknown author went something like this: We mastered the air, we conquered the sea, annihilated distance and prolonged life, but we're not wise enough to live on this earth without war and without hate.As for Jesse Jackson: I'm tired of sailing my little boat, far inside the harbor bar. I want to go out where the big ships float, out on the deep where the great ones are. And should my frail craft prove too slight for waves that sweep those billows o'er, I'd rather go down in the stirring fight than drowse to death at the sheltered shore.We've got to go out, my friends, where the big boats are.And then for our children. Young America, hold your head high now. We can win. We must not lose you to drugs and violence, premature pregnancy, suicide, cynicism, pessimism and despair. We can win. Wherever you are tonight, I challenge you to hope and to dream. Don't submerge your dreams. Exercise above all else, even on drugs, dream of the day you are drug free. Even in the gutter, dream of the day that you will be up on your feet again.You must never stop dreaming. Face reality, yes, but don't stop with the way things are. Dream of things as they ought to be. Dream. Face pain, but love, hope, faith and dreams will help you rise above the pain. Use hope and imagination as weapons of survival and progress, but you keep on dreaming, young America. Dream of peace. Peace is rational and reasonable. War is irrationable [sic] in this age, and unwinnable.Dream of teachers who teach for life and not for a living. Dream of doctors who are concerned more about public health than private wealth. Dream of lawyers more concerned about justice than a judgeship. Dream of preachers who are concerned more about prophecy than profiteering. Dream on the high road with sound values.And then America, as we go forth to September, October, November and then beyond, America must never surrender to a high moral challenge.Do not surrender to drugs. The best drug policy is a no first use. Don't surrender with needles and cynicism. Let's have no first use on the one hand, or clinics on the other. Never surrender, young America. Go forward.America must never surrender to malnutrition. We can feed the hungry and clothe the naked. We must never surrender. We must go forward.We must never surrender to illiteracy. Invest in our children. Never surrender; and go forward. We must never surrender to inequality. Women cannot compromise ERA or comparable worth. Women are making 60 cents on the dollar to what a man makes. Women cannot buy meat cheaper. Women cannot buy bread cheaper. Women cannot buy milk cheaper. Women deserve to get paid for the work that you do. It's right! And it's fair.Don't surrender, my friends. Those who have AIDS tonight, you deserve our compassion. Even with AIDS you must not surrender.In your wheelchairs. I see you sitting here tonight in those wheelchairs. I've stayed with you. I've reached out to you across our Nation. And don't you give up. I know it's tough sometimes. People look down on you. It took you a little more effort to get here tonight. And no one should look down on you, but sometimes mean people do. The only justification we have for looking down on someone is that we're going to stop and pick them up.But even in your wheelchairs, don't you give up. We cannot forget 50 years ago when our backs were against the wall, Roosevelt was in a wheelchair. I would rather have Roosevelt in a wheelchair than Reagan and Bush on a horse. Don't you surrender and don't you give up. Don't surrender and don't give up!Why I cannot challenge you this way? Jesse Jackson, you don't understand my situation. You be on television. You don't understand. I see you with the big people. You don't understand my situation.I understand. You see me on TV, but you don't know the me that makes me, me. They wonder, Why does Jesse run? because they see me running for the White House. They don't see the house I'm running from.I have a story. I wasn't always on television. Writers were not always outside my door. When I was born late one afternoon, October 8th, in Greenville, South Carolina, no writers asked my mother her name. Nobody chose to write down our address. My mama was not supposed to make it, and I was not supposed to make it. You see, I was born of a teen-age mother, who was born of a teen-age mother.I understand. I know abandonment, and people being mean to you, and saying you're nothing and nobody and can never be anything.I understand. Jesse Jackson is my third name. I'm adopted. When I had no name, my grandmother gave me her name. My name was Jesse Burns 'til I was 12. So I wouldn't have a blank space, she gave me a name to hold me over. I understand when nobody knows your name. I understand when you have no name.I understand. I wasn't born in the hospital. Mama didn't have insurance. I was born in the bed at [the] house. I really do understand. Born in a three-room house, bathroom in the backyard, slop jar by the bed, no hot and cold running water. I understand. Wallpaper used for decoration? No. For a windbreaker. I understand. I'm a working person's person. That's why I understand you whether you're Black or White. I understand work. I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I had a shovel programmed for my hand.My mother, a working woman. So many of the days she went to work early, with runs in her stockings. She knew better, but she wore runs in her stockings so that my brother and I could have matching socks and not be laughed at at school. I understand.At 3 o'clock on Thanksgiving Day, we couldn't eat turkey because momma was preparing somebody else's turkey at 3 o'clock. We had to play football to entertain ourselves. And then around 6 o'clock she would get off the Alta Vista bus and we would bring up the leftovers and eat our turkey -- leftovers, the carcass, the cranberries -- around 8 o'clock at night. I really do understand.Every one of these funny labels they put on you, those of you who are watching this broadcast tonight in the projects, on the corners, I understand. Call you outcast, low down, you can't make it, you're nothing, you're from nobody, subclass, underclass; when you see Jesse Jackson, when my name goes in nomination, your name goes in nomination.I was born in the slum, but the slum was not born in me. And it wasn't born in you, and you can make it.Wherever you are tonight, you can make it. Hold your head high; stick your chest out. You can make it. It gets dark sometimes, but the morning comes. Don't you surrender! Suffering breeds character, character breeds faith. In the end faith will not disappoint.You must not surrender! You may or may not get there but just know that you're qualified! And you hold on, and hold out! We must never surrender!! America will get better and better.Keep hope alive. Keep hope alive! Keep hope alive! On tomorrow night and beyond, keep hope alive!I love you very much. I love you very much.Also in this database: Jesse Jackson - 1984 DNC AddressU.S. Copyright Status: Text = Restricted, seek permission. Audio and Image (Screenshot) = Uncertain.

(2)]Less than three months ago at platform hearings in Salt Lake City, I asked the Republican Party to lift the shroud of silence which has been drapedover the issue of HIV and AIDS.  I have come tonight to bring our silence to an end.  I bear a message of challenge, not self-congratulation.  I want your attention, not yourapplause.I would never have asked to be HIV positive, but I believe that in all things there is a purpose; and I stand before you and before the nation gladly.  The reality ofAIDS is brutally clear.  Two hundred thousand Americans are dead or dying.  A million more areinfected.  Worldwide, forty million, sixty million, or a hundred million infections will be counted in the coming few years.  But despite science and research, White Housemeetings, and congressional hearings, despite good intentions and bold initiatives, campaign slogans, and hopeful promises, it is-- despite it all -- the epidemic which iswinning tonight.In the context of an election year, I ask you, here in this great hall, or listening in the quiet of your home, to recognize that AIDS virus is not a politicalcreature.  It does not care whether you are Democrat or Republican; it does not ask whether you are black or white, male or female, gay or straight, young or old.Tonight, Irepresent an AIDS community whose members have been reluctantly drafted from every segment of American society.Though I am white and a mother, I am one with a black infant struggling with tubes in a Philadelphia hospital. Though I am female and contracted this disease in marriage and enjoy the warm support of my family, I am one with the lonely gay man sheltering a flickeringcandle from the cold wind of his familyåÕs rejection.This is not a distant threat.  It is a present danger.  The rate of infection is increasing fastest among women and children.  Largely unknown a decade ago, AIDS isthe third leading killer of young adult Americans today.  But it wonåÕt be third for long, because unlike other diseases, this one travels.  Adolescents donåÕt give each othercancer or heart disease because they believe they are in love, but HIV is different; and we have helped it along. We have killed each other with our ignorance, our prejudice,and our silence.We may take refuge in our stereotypes, but we cannot hide there long, because HIV asks only one thing of those it attacks.  Are you human?  And this is the rightquestion.  Are you human?  Because people with HIV have not entered some alien state of being.  They are human.  They have not earned cruelty, and they do not deservemeanness.  They donåÕt benefit from being isolated or treated as outcasts.  Each of them is exactly what God made: a person; not evil, deserving of our judgment; notvictims, longing for our pity -- people, ready for support and worthy of compassion.My call to you, my Party, is to take a public stand, no less compassionate than that of the President and Mrs. Bush.  They have embraced me and my family inmemorable ways.  In the place of judgment, they have shown affection.  In difficult moments, they have raised our spirits.  In the darkest hours, I have seen them reachingnot only to me, but also to my parents, armed with that stunning grief and special grace that comes only to parents who have themselves leaned too long over the bedsideof a dying child.With the PresidentåÕs leadership, much good has been done.  Much of the good has gone unheralded, and as the President has insisted, much remains to be done.But we do the PresidentåÕs cause no good if we praise the American family but ignore a virus thatdestroys it.We must be consistent if we are to be believed.  We cannot love justice and ignoreprejudice, love our children and fear to teach them.  Whatever our role as parentor policymaker, we must act as eloquently as we speak -- else we have no integrity.My call to the nation is a plea for awareness.  If you believe you are safe, you are in danger.Because I was not hemophiliac, I was not at risk.  Because I was not gay, I was not at risk.  Because I did not inject drugs, I was not at risk.My father has devoted much of his lifetime guarding against another holocaust.  He is part of the generation who heard Pastor Nemoellor come out of the Nazideath camps to say, åÒThey came after the Jews, and I was not a Jew, so, I did not protest.  They came after the trade unionists, and I was not a trade unionist, so, I did notprotest.  Then they came after the Roman Catholics, and I was not a Roman Catholic, so, I did not protest.  Then they came after me, and there was no one left toprotest.åÓThe -- The lesson history teaches is this:  If you believe you are safe, you are at risk.  If you do not see this killer stalking your children, look again.  There is no family orcommunity, no race or religion, no place left in America that is safe.  Until we genuinely embrace this message, we are a nation at risk.  Tonight, HIV marches resolutely towardAIDS in more than a million American homes, littering its pathway with the bodies of the young -- young men, young women, young parents, and young children. One of the families is mine.  If it is true that HIV inevitably turns to AIDS, then my children will inevitably turn to orphans.My family has been a rock of support.My 84-year-old father, who has pursued the healing of the nations, will not accept the premise that he cannot heal hisdaughter.  My mother refuses to be broken.  She still calls at midnight to tell wonderful jokes that make me laugh.  Sisters and friends, and my brother Phillip, whosebirthday is today, all have helped carry me over the hardest places.  I am blessed, richly and deeply blessed, to have such a family.But not all of you -- But not all of you have been so blessed.  You are HIV positive, but dare not say it.  You have lost loved ones, but you dare not whisper the word AIDS. You weepsilently.  You grieve alone.  I have a message for you.  It is not you who should feel shame.  It is we -- we who tolerate ignorance and practice prejudice, we who have taughtyou to fear.  We must lift our shroud of silence, making it safe for you to reach out for compassion.  It is our task to seek safety for our children, not in quiet denial, but ineffective action.Someday our children will be grown.  My son Max, now four, will take the measure of hismother.  My son Zachary, now two, will sort through his memories.  I may not be here to hear their judgments, but I know already what I hope they are.  I want my children to know that their mother was not a victim.  She was a messenger.  I donot want them to think, as I once did, that courage is the absence of fear.  I want them to know that courage is the strength to act wisely when most we are afraid.  I wantthem to have the courage to step forward when called by their nation or their Party and give leadership, no matter what the personal cost.I ask no more of you than I askof myself or of my children.  To the millions of you who are grieving, who are frightened, who have suffered the ravages of AIDS firsthand: Have courage, and you will findsupport.  To the millions who are strong, I issue the plea: Set aside prejudice and politics to make room for compassion and soundpolicy.To my children, I make this pledge:  I will not give in, Zachary, because I draw my courage from you.  Your silly giggle gives me hope; your gentle prayers give mestrength; and you, my child, give me the reason to say to America, You are at risk.  And I will not rest,Max, until I have done all I can to make your world safe.  I will seek a place where intimacy is not the prelude to suffering.  I will not hurry to leave you, my children, but when I go, I pray that you will not suffer shame on my account.To all within the sound of my voice, I appeal:  Learn with me the lessons of history and of grace, so my children will not be afraid to say the word AIDS when I am gone.Then, their children and yours may not need to whisper it at all.God bless the children, and Godbless us all.Good night.Also in this database:Elizabeth Glaser - 1992 Democratic National Convention AddressAlso in this database:Patrick J.

This university has been coeducational since 1870, but I do not believe it was on the basis of your accomplishments that a Detroit high school girl said (and I quote), In choosing a college, you first have to decide whether you want a coeducational school or an educational school. Well, we can find both here at Michigan, although perhaps at different hours. I came out here today very anxious to meet the Michigan student whose father told a friend of mine that his son's education had been a real value. It stopped his mother from bragging about him.I have come today from the turmoil of your capital to the tranquility of your campus to speak about the future of your country. The purpose of protecting the life of our Nation and preserving the liberty of our citizens is to pursue the happiness of our people. Our success in that pursuit is the test of our success as a Nation.For a century we labored to settle and to subdue a continent. For half a century we called upon unbounded invention and untiring industry to create an order of plenty for all of our people. The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use that wealth to enrich and elevate our national life, and to advance the quality of our American civilization.Your imagination and your initiative and your indignation will determine whether we build a society where progress is the servant of our needs, or a society where old values and new visions are buried under unbridled growth. For in your time we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society, but upward to the Great Society.The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning.The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what is adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods.But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.So I want to talk to you today about three places where we begin to build the Great Society -- in our cities, in our countryside, and in our classrooms.Many of you will live to see the day, perhaps 50 years from now, when there will be 400 million Americans -- four-fifths of them in urban areas. In the remainder of this century urban population will double, city land will double, and we will have to build homes and highways and facilities equal to all those built since this country was first settled. So in the next 40 years we must re-build the entire urban United States.Aristotle said: Men come together in cities in order to live, but they remain together in order to live the good life. It is harder and harder to live the good life in American cities today. The catalog of ills is long: there is the decay of the centers and the despoiling of the suburbs. There is not enough housing for our people or transportation for our traffic. Open land is vanishing and old landmarks are violated. Worst of all expansion is eroding these precious and time honored values of community with neighbors and communion with nature. The loss of these values breeds loneliness and boredom and indifference.And our society will never be great until our cities are great. Today the frontier of imagination and innovation is inside those cities and not beyond their borders. New experiments are already going on. It will be the task of your generation to make the American city a place where future generations will come, not only to live, but to live the good life. And I understand that if I stayed here tonight I would see that Michigan students are really doing their best to live the good life.This is the place where the Peace Corps was started.It is inspiring to see how all of you, while you are in this country, are trying so hard to live at the level of the people.A second place where we begin to build the Great Society is in our countryside. We have always prided ourselves on being not only America the strong and America the free, but America the beautiful. Today that beauty is in danger. The water we drink, the food we eat, the very air that we breathe, are threatened with pollution. Our parks are overcrowded, our seashores overburdened. Green fields and dense forests are disappearing.A few years ago we were greatly concerned about the Ugly American. Today we must act to prevent an ugly America.For once the battle is lost, once our natural splendor is destroyed, it can never be recaptured. And once man can no longer walk with beauty or wonder at nature his spirit will wither and his sustenance be wasted.A third place to build the Great Society is in the classrooms of America. There your children's lives will be shaped. Our society will not be great until every young mind is set free to scan the farthest reaches of thought and imagination. We are still far from that goal. Today, 8 million adult Americans, more than the entire population of Michigan, have not finished 5 years of school. Nearly 20 million have not finished 8 years of school. Nearly 54 million -- more than one quarter of all America -- have not even finished high school.Each year more than 100,000 high school graduates, with proved ability, do not enter college because they cannot afford it. And if we cannot educate today's youth, what will we do in 1970 when elementary school enrollment will be 5 million greater than 1960? And high school enrollment will rise by 5 million. And college enrollment will increase by more than 3 million.In many places, classrooms are overcrowded and curricula are outdated. Most of our qualified teachers are underpaid and many of our paid teachers are unqualified. So we must give every child a place to sit and a teacher to learn from. Poverty must not be a bar to learning, and learning must offer an escape from poverty.But more classrooms and more teachers are not enough. We must seek an educational system which grows in excellence as it grows in size. This means better training for our teachers. It means preparing youth to enjoy their hours of leisure as well as their hours of labor. It means exploring new techniques of teaching, to find new ways to stimulate the love of learning and the capacity for creation.These are three of the central issues of the  Great Society. While our Government has many programs directed at those issues, I do not pretend that we have the full answer to those problems. But I do promise this: We are going to assemble the best thought and the broadest knowledge from all over the world to find those answers for America.I intend to establish working groups to prepare a series of White House conferences and meetings -- on the cities, on natural beauty, on the quality of education, and on other emerging challenges. And from these meetings and from this inspiration and from these studies we will begin to set our course toward the Great Society.The solution to these problems does not rest on a massive program in Washington, nor can it rely solely on the strained resources of local authority. They require us to create new concepts of cooperation, a creative federalism, between the National Capital and the leaders of local communities.Woodrow Wilson once wrote: Every man sent out from his university should be a man of his Nation as well as a man of his time.Within your lifetime powerful forces, already loosed, will take us toward a way of life beyond the realm of our experience, almost beyond the bounds of our imagination.For better or for worse, your generation has been appointed by history to deal with those problems and to lead America toward a new age. You have the chance never before afforded to any people in any age. You can help build a society where the demands of morality, and the needs of the spirit, can be realized in the life of the Nation.So, will you join in the battle to give every citizen the full equality which God enjoins and the law requires, whatever his belief, or race, or the color of his skin?Will you join in the battle to give every citizen an escape from the crushing weight of poverty?Will you join in the battle to make it possible for all nations to live in enduring peace -- as neighbors and not as mortal enemies?Will you join in the battle to build the Great Society, to prove that our material progress is only the foundation on which we will build a richer life of mind and spirit?There are those timid souls that say this battle cannot be won; that we are condemned to a soulless wealth. I do not agree. We have the power to shape the civilization that we want. But we need your will and your labor and your hearts, if we are to build that kind of society.Those who came to this land sought to build more than just a new country. They sought a new world. So I have come here today to your campus to say that you can make their vision our reality. So let us from this moment begin our work so that in the future men will look back and say: It was then, after a long and weary way, that man turned the exploits of his genius to the full enrichment of his life.Thank you.

MarshallThe Marshall Plan   delivered 5 June 1947 at Harvard University    Plug-in required for flash audiovar so = new );  "", ""georgemarshallplan."");   ;   for flash[  fromaudio.]Mr. President, Dr. Conant, members of the Board of Overseers, Ladiesand Gentlemen: I am profoundly grateful, touched by the great distinction and honorand great compliment accorded me by the authorities of Harvard this morning.I am overwhelmed, as a matter of fact, and I am rather fearful of my inabilityto maintain such a high rating as you've been generous enough to accordto me. In these historic and lovely surroundings, this perfect day, and this very wonderfulassembly, it is a tremendously impressive thing to an individual in myposition.But to speak more seriously, I need not tell you that the world situationis very serious. That must be apparent to all intelligent people. I thinkone difficulty is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very mass of factspresented to the public by press and radio make it exceedingly difficultfor the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation. Furthermore,the people of this country are distant from the troubled areas of the earth,and it is hard for them to comprehend the plight and consequent reactionsof the long-suffering peoples of Europe and the effect of those reactionson their governments in connection with our efforts to promote peace inthe world.In considering the requirements for the rehabilitation of Europe, thephysical loss of life, the visible destruction of cities, factories, mines,and railroads was correctly estimated, but it has become obvious during recent months that thisvisible destruction was probably less serious than the dislocation of theentire fabric of European economy. For the past ten years conditions have been highly abnormal.The feverish preparation for war and the more feverish maintenance of thewar effort engulfed all aspects of national economies. Machinery has falleninto disrepair or is entirely obsolete. Under the arbitrary and destructiveNazi rule, virtually every possible enterprise was geared into the Germanwar machine. Long-standing commercial ties, private institutions, banks,insurance companies, and shipping companies disappeared through loss ofcapital, absorption through nationalization, or by simple destruction.In many countries, confidence in the local currency has been severely shaken.The breakdown of the business structure of Europe during the war was complete.Recovery has been seriously retarded by the fact that two years after theclose of hostilities a peace settlement with Germany and Austria has notbeen agreed upon. But even given a more prompt solution of these difficult problems, the rehabilitation of the economic structure of Europe quiteevidently will require a much longer time and greater effort than had beenforeseen.There is a phase of this matter which is both interesting and serious.The farmer has always produced the foodstuffs to exchange with the citydweller for the other necessities of life. This division of labor is the basis of moderncivilization. At the present time it is threatened with breakdown. Thetown and city industries are not producing adequate goods to exchange with the food-producing farmer.Raw materials and fuel are in short supply. Machinery, as I have said,is lacking or worn out. The farmer or the peasant cannot find the goodsfor sale which he desires to purchase. So the sale of his farm producefor money which he cannot use seems to him an unprofitable transaction.He, therefore, has withdrawn many fields from crop cultivation and he'susing them for grazing. He feeds more grain to stock and finds for himselfand his family an ample supply of food, however short he may be on clothingand the other ordinary gadgets of civilization.  Meanwhile, people in the cities are short of food and fuel, and in someplaces approaching the starvation levels. So, the governments are forcedto use their foreign money and credits to procure these necessities abroad.This process exhausts funds which are urgently needed for reconstruction.Thus, a very serious situation is rapidly developing which bodes no goodfor the world. The modern system of the division of labor upon which theexchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down. The truthof the matter is that Europe's requirements for the next three or fouryears of foreign food and other essential products -- principally fromAmerica -- are so much greater than her present ability to pay that shemust have substantial additional help or face economic, social, and politicaldeterioration of a very grave character. The remedy seems to lie in breaking the vicious circle and restoringthe confidence of the people of Europe in the economic future of theirown countries and of Europe as a whole. The manufacturer and the farmerthroughout wide areas must be able and willing to exchange their productfor currencies, the continuing value of which is not open to question.  Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilitiesof disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned,the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparentto all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is ableto do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which therecan be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is directednot against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation,and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in theworld so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditionsin which free institutions can exist.Such assistance, I am convinced, must not be on a piecemeal basis, asvarious crises develop. Any assistance that this Government may renderin the future should provide a cure rather than a mere palliative. Anygovernment that is willing to assist in the task of recovery will findfull cooperation, I am sure, on the part of the United States Government.Any government which maneuvers to block the recovery of other countriescannot expect help from us. Furthermore, governments, political parties,or groups which seek to perpetuate human misery in order to profit therefrom politically or otherwise will encounter the opposition of the UnitedStates.It is already evident that before the United States Government can proceedmuch further in its efforts to alleviate the situation and help start theEuropean world on its way to recovery, there must be some agreement among the countriesof Europe as to the requirements of the situation and the part those countriesthemselves will take in order to give a proper effect to whatever actions mightbe undertaken by this Government. It would be neither fitting nor efficaciousfor our Government to undertake to draw up unilaterally a program designedto place Europe on its feet economically. This is the business of the Europeans.The initiative, I think, must come from Europe. The role of this country should consist of friendlyaid in the drafting of a European program and of later support of sucha program so far as it may be practical for us to do so. The program should be a joint one,agreed to by a number, if not all, European nations.  An essential part of any successful action on the part of the UnitedStates is an understanding on the part of the people of America of thecharacter of the problem and the remedies to be applied. Political passion and prejudice shouldhave no part. With foresight, and a willingness on the part of our peopleto face up to the vast responsibility which history has clearly placedupon our country, the difficulties I have outlined can and will be overcome.  I am sorry that on each occasion I have said something publicly in regardto our international situation, I have been forced by the necessities ofthe case to enter into rather technical discussions. But, to my mind, it is of vast importancethat our people reach some general understanding of what the complicationsreally are, rather than react from a passion or a prejudice or an emotion of the moment.  As I said more formally a moment ago, we are remote from the scene ofthese troubles. It is virtually impossible at this distance merely by reading,or listening, or even seeing photographs and motion pictures, to graspat all the real significance of the situation. And yet the whole worldof the future hangs on a proper judgment. It hangs, I think, to a largeextent on the realization of the American people, of just what are thevarious dominant factors. What are the reactions of the people? What arethe justifications of those reactions? What are the sufferings? What isneeded? What can best be done? What must be done? Thank you very much.Book/CDs by Michael E. Eidenmuller, Published by McGraw-Hill (2008)  Also   in this database: Harry S.

And let me say, that I never expected to hear such kind words from Dr. Falwell. So in return, I have an invitation of my own. On January 20th, 1985, I hope Dr. Falwell will say a prayer at the inauguration of the next Democratic President of the United States. Now, Dr. Falwell, IåÕm not exactly sure how you feel about that. You might not appreciate the President, but the Democrats certainly would appreciate the prayer.Actually, a number of people in Washington were surprised that I was invited to speak here -- and even more surprised when I accepted the invitation. They seem to think that itåÕs easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle than for a Kennedy to come to the campus of Liberty Baptist College. In honor of our meeting, I have asked Dr. Falwell, as your Chancellor, to permit all the students an extra hour next Saturday night before curfew. And in return, I have promised to watch the Old Time Gospel Hour next Sunday morning.I realize that my visit may be a little controversial. But as many of you have heard, Dr. Falwell recently sent me a membership in the Moral Majority -- and I didn't even apply for it. And I wonder if that means that I'm a member in good standing. [Falwell: Somewhat]Somewhat, he says. This is, of course, a nonpolitical speech which is probably best under the circumstances. Since I am not a candidate for President, it would certainly be inappropriate to ask for your support in this election and probably inaccurate to thank you for it in the last one. I have come here to discuss my beliefs about faith and country,tolerance and truth in America. I know we begin with certain disagreements; and I stronglysuspect that at the end of the evening some of our disagreements will remain. But I alsohope that tonight and in the months and years ahead, we will always respect the right ofothers to differ, that we will never lose sight of our own fallibility, and that we will viewourselves with a sense of perspective and a sense of humor. After all, in the NewTestament, even the Disciples had to be taught to look first to the beam in their owneyes, and only then to the mote in their neighbor&#146;s eyes.I am mindful of that counsel. I am an American and a Catholic; Ilove my country and treasure my faith. But I do not assume that my conception ofpatriotism or policy is invariably correct, or that my convictions about religion shouldcommand any greater respect than any other faith in this pluralistic society. I believethere surely is such a thing as truth, but who among us can claim a monopoly on it?There are those who do, and their own words testify to theirintolerance. For example, because the Moral Majority has worked with members of differentdenominations, one fundamentalist group has denounced Dr. Falwell for hasteningthe ecumenical church and for yoking together with Roman Catholics, Mormons, andothers. I am relieved that Dr. Falwell does not regard that as a sin, and on thisissue, he himself has become the target of narrow prejudice. When people agree on publicpolicy, they ought to be able to work together, even while they worship in diverse ways.For truly we are all yoked together as Americans, and the yoke is the happy one ofindividual freedom and mutual respect.But in saying that, we cannot and should not turn aside from adeeper and more pressing question -- which is whether and how religion should influencegovernment. A generation ago, a presidential candidate had to prove his independence ofundue religious influence in public life, and he had to do so partly at the insistence ofevangelical Protestants. John Kennedy said at that time: &#147;I believe in an Americawhere there is no  religious bloc voting of any kind.&#148; Only twenty years later,another candidate was appealing to a[n] evangelical meeting as a religious bloc. RonaldReagan said to 15 thousand evangelicals at the Roundtable in Dallas: &#147; I know thatyou can&#146;t endorse me. I want you to know I endorse you and what you aredoing.&#148;To many Americans, that pledge was a sign and a symbol of adangerous breakdown in the separation of church and state. Yet this principle, as vital asit is, is not a simplistic and rigid command. Separation of church and state cannot meanan absolute separation between moral principles and political power. The challenge todayis to recall the origin of the principle, to define its purpose, and refine itsapplication to the politics of the present.The founders of our nation had long and bitter experience with thestate, as both the agent and the adversary of particular religious views. In colonialMaryland, Catholics paid a double land tax, and in Pennsylvania they had to list theirnames on a public roll -- an ominous precursor of the first Nazi laws against the Jews. AndJews in turn faced discrimination in all of the thirteen original Colonies. Massachusettsexiled Roger Williams and his congregation for contending that civil government had noright to enforce the Ten Commandments. Virginia harassed Baptist teachers, and alsoestablished a religious test for public service, writing into the law that no &#147;popishfollowers&#148; could hold any office.But during the Revolution, Catholics, Jews, and Non-Conformists allrallied to the cause and fought valiantly for the American commonwealth -- for JohnWinthrop&#146;s &#147;city upon a hill.&#148; Afterwards, when the Constitution wasratified and then amended, the framers gave freedom for all religion, and from anyestablished religion, the very first place in the Bill of Rights.Indeed the framers themselves professed very differentfaiths: Washington was an Episcopalian, Jefferson a deist, and Adams a Calvinist. Andalthough he had earlier opposed toleration, John Adams later contributed to the buildingof Catholic churches, and so did George Washington. Thomas Jefferson said his proudestachievement was not the presidency, or the writing the Declaration of Independence, butdrafting the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom. He stated the vision of the firstAmericans and the First Amendment very clearly: &#147;The God who gave us life gave usliberty at the same time.&#148;The separation of church and state can sometimes be frustrating forwomen and men of religious faith. They may be tempted to misuse government in orderto impose a value which they cannot persuade others to accept. But once we succumb to thattemptation, we step onto a slippery slope where everyone&#146;s freedom is at risk. Thosewho favor censorship should recall that one of the first books ever burned was the firstEnglish translation of the Bible. As President Eisenhower warned in 1953, &#147;Don&#146;tjoin the book burners...the right to say ideas, the right to record them, and the right tohave them accessible to others is unquestioned -- or this isn&#146;t America.&#148; And ifthat right is denied, at some future day the torch can be turned against any other book orany other belief. Let us never forget: Today&#146;s Moral Majority could becometomorrow&#146;s persecuted minority.The danger is as great now as when the founders of the nation firstsaw it. In 1789, their fear was of factional strife among dozens of denominations. Todaythere are hundreds -- and perhaps even thousands of faiths -- and millions of Americans who areoutside any fold. Pluralism obviously does not and cannot mean that all of them are right;but it does mean that there are areas where government cannot and should not decide whatis wrong to believe, to think, to read, and to do. As Professor Larry Tribe, one of thenation&#146;s leading constitutional scholars has written, &#147;Law in a non-theocratic state cannot measure religious truth, nor can the state impose it.The real transgression occurs when religion wants government to tellcitizens how to live uniquely personal parts of their lives. The failure of Prohibitionproves the futility of such an attempt when a majority or even a substantial minorityhappens to disagree. Some questions may be inherently individual ones, or people may besharply divided about whether they are. In such cases, like Prohibition andabortion, the proper role of religion is to appeal to the conscience of the individual,not the coercive power of the state. But there are other questions which are inherently public in nature,which we must decide together as a nation, and where religion and religious values can andshould speak to our common conscience. The issue of nuclear war is a compelling example.It is a moral issue; it will be decided by government, not by each individual; and to giveany effect to the moral values of their creed, people of faith must speak directly aboutpublic policy. The Catholic bishops and the Reverend Billy Graham have every right tostand for the nuclear freeze, and Dr. Falwell has every right to stand against it.There must be standards for the exercise of such leadership, so thatthe obligations of belief will not be debased into an opportunity for mere politicaladvantage. But to take a stand at all when a question is both properly public and trulymoral is to stand in a long and honored tradition. Many of the great evangelists of the1800s were in the forefront of the abolitionist movement. In our own time, the ReverendWilliam Sloane Coffin challenged the morality of the war in Vietnam. Pope John XXIIIrenewed the Gospel&#146;s call to social justice. And Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who wasthe greatest prophet of this century, awakened our nation and its conscience to the evil ofracial segregation. Their words have blessed our world. And who now wishes they had been silent? Who would bid Pope John Paul [II] to quiet his voice against the oppression inEastern Europe, the violence in Central America, or the crying needs of the landless, thehungry, and those who are tortured in so many of the dark political prisons of our time?President Kennedy, who said that &#147;no religious body should seekto impose its will,&#148; also urged religious leaders to state their views and give theircommitment when the public debate involved ethical issues. In drawing the line betweenimposed will and essential witness, we keep church and state separate, and at the sametime we recognize that the City of God should speak to the civic duties of men and women.There are four tests which draw that line and define the difference.First, we must respect the integrity of religion itself.People of conscience should be careful how they deal in the word oftheir Lord. In our own history, religion has been falsely invoked to sanction prejudice -- even slavery -- to condemn labor unions and public spending for the poor. I believe thatthe prophecy, The poor you always have with you is an indictment, not acommandment. And I respectfully suggest that God has taken no position on the Department of Education -- and that a balanced budget constitutional amendment is a matter of economicanalysis, and not heavenly appeals.Religious values cannot be excluded from every public issue; but notevery public issue involves religious values. And how ironic it is when those very valuesare denied in the name of religion. For example, we are sometimes told that it is wrong tofeed the hungry, but that mission is an explicit mandate given to us in the 25th chapterof Matthew.Second, we must respect the independent judgments of conscience.Those who proclaim moral and religious values can offer counsel, butthey should not casually treat a position on a public issue as a test of fealty to faith.Just as I disagree with the Catholic bishops on tuition tax credits -- which I oppose -- soother Catholics can and do disagree with the hierarchy, on the basis of honest conviction,on the question of the nuclear freeze.Thus, the controversy about the Moral Majority arises not only fromits views, but from its name -- which, in the minds of many, seems to imply that only one setof public policies is moral and only one majority can possibly be right. Similarly, people are and should be perplexed when thereligious lobbying group Christian Voice publishes a morality index of congressionalvoting records, which judges the morality of senators by their attitude toward Zimbabweand Taiwan. Let me offer another illustration. Dr. Falwell has written -- and Iquote: &#147;To stand against Israel is to stand against God.&#148; Now there is no one inthe Senate who has stood more firmly for Israel than I have. Yet, I do not doubt the faithof those on the other side. Their error is not one of religion, but of policy. And I hopeto be able to persuade them that -- that they are wrong in terms of both America&#146;s interest and thejustice of Israel&#146;s cause.Respect for conscience is most in jeopardy, and the harmony of ourdiverse society is most at risk, when we re-establish, directly or indirectly, a religioustest for public office. That relic of the colonial era, which is specifically prohibitedin the Constitution, has reappeared in recent years. After the last election, the ReverendJames Robison -- Robison warned President Reagan no to surround himself, as president before him had,&#147;with the counsel of the ungodly.&#148; I utterly reject any such standard for anyposition anywhere in public service. Two centuries ago, the victims were Catholics andJews. In the 1980s the victims could be atheists; in some other day or decade, they couldbe the members of the Thomas Road Baptist Church. Indeed, in 1976 I regarded it asunworthy and un-American when some people said or hinted that Jimmy Carter should not bepresident because he was a born again Christian. We must never judge the fitness ofindividuals to govern on the bas[is] of where they worship, whether they follow Christ orMoses, whether they are called &#147;born again&#148; or &#147;ungodly.&#148; Where it isright to apply moral values to public life, let all of us avoid the temptation to beself-righteous and absolutely certain of ourselves. And if that temptation ever comes, letus recall Winston Churchill&#146;s humbling description of an intolerant and inflexiblecolleague: &#147;There but for the grace of God goes God.&#148;Third, in applying religious values, we must respect the integrityof public debate.In that debate, faith is no substitute for facts. Critics may opposethe nuclear freeze for what they regard as moral reasons. They have every right to arguethat any negotiation with the Soviets is wrong, or that any accommodation with themsanctions their crimes, or that no agreement can be good enough and therefore allagreements only increase the chance of war. I do not believe that, but it surely does notviolate the standard of fair public debate to say it. What does violate that standard, what the opponents of the nuclearfreeze have no right to do, is to assume that they are infallible, and so any argumentagainst the freeze will do, whether it is false or true.The nuclear freeze proposal is not unilateral, but bilateral -- withequal restraints on the United States and the Soviet Union. The nuclear freeze does not require that we trust the Russians, butdemands full and effective verification. The nuclear freeze does not concede a Soviet lead in nuclearweapons, but recognizes that human beings in each great power already have in theirfallible hands the overwhelming capacity to remake into a pile of radioactive rubble theearth which God has made. There is no morality -- There is no morality in the mushroom cloud. The black rain ofnuclear ashes will fall alike on the just and the unjust. And then it will be too late to wishthat we had done the real work of this atomic age -- which is to seek a world that isneither red nor dead.I am perfectly prepared to debate the nuclear freeze on policygrounds, or moral ones. But we should not be forced to discuss phantom issues or falsecharges. They only deflect us form the urgent task of deciding how best to prevent aplanet divided from becoming a planet destroyed.And it does not advance the debate to contend that the arms race ismore divine punishment than human problem, or that in any event, the final days are near.As Pope John said two decades ago, at the opening of the Second Vatican Council: &#147;Wemust beware of those who burn with zeal, but are not endowed with much sense... we mustdisagree with the prophets of doom, who are always forecasting disasters, as though the endof the earth was at hand.&#148; The message which echoes across the years is very clear: Theearth is still here; and if we wish to keep it, a prophecy of doom is no alternative to apolicy of arms control.Fourth, and finally, we must respect the motives of those whoexercise their right to disagree.We sorely test our ability to live together if we readilyquestion each other&#146;s integrity. It may be harder to restrain our feelings when moralprinciples are at stake, for they go to the deepest wellsprings of our being. But the moreour feelings diverge, the more deeply felt they are, the greater is our obligation togrant the sincerity and essential decency of our fellow citizens on the other side.Those who favor E.R.A [Equal Rights Amendment] are not&#147;antifamily&#148; or &#147;blasphemers.&#148; And their purpose is not &#147;an attackon the Bible.&#148; Rather, we believe this is the best way to fix in our nationalfirmament the ideal that not only all men, but all people are created equal. Indeed, mymother, who strongly favors E.R.A., would be surprised to hear that she is anti-family.For my part, I think of the amendment&#146;s opponents as wrong on the issue, but not aslacking in moral characterI could multiply the instances of name-calling, sometimes on bothsides. Dr. Falwell is not a &#147;warmonger.&#148; And &#147;liberal clergymen&#148; arenot, as the Moral Majority suggested in a recent letter, equivalent to &#147;Sovietsympathizers.&#148; The critics of official prayer in public schools are not&#147;Pharisees&#148;; many of them are both civil libertarians and believers, who thinkthat families should pray more at home with their children, and attend church andsynagogue more faithfully. And people are not sexist because they stand against abortion, and they are not murderers because they believe in free choice.Nor does it help anyone -- Nor does it help anyone&#146;s cause to shout such epithets, or to try and shout a speaker down -- which is what happened last April when Dr. Falwell washissed and heckled at Harvard. So I am doubly grateful for your courtesy here this evening. Thatwas not Harvard&#146;s finest hour, but I am happy to say that the loudest applause fromthe Harvard audience came in defense of Dr. Falwell&#146;s right to speak.In short, I hope for an America where neither fundamentalist norhumanist will be a dirty word, but a fair description of the different ways in whichpeople of goodwill look at life and into their own souls.I hope for an America where no president, no public official, noindividual will ever be deemed a greater or lesser American because of religious doubt -- orreligious belief.I hope for an America where the power of faith will always burnbrightly, but where no modern Inquisition of any kind will ever light the fires of fear,coercion, or angry division.I hope for an America where we can all contend freely andvigorously, but where we will treasure and guard those standards of civility which alonemake this nation safe for both democracy and diversity.Twenty years ago this fall, in New York City, President Kennedy metfor the last time with a Protestant assembly. The atmosphere had been transformed sincehis earlier address during the 1960 campaign to the Houston Ministerial Association. Hehad spoken there to allay suspicions about his Catholicism, and to answer those who claimed that on the day of his baptism, he was somehow disqualified frombecoming President. His speech in Houston and then his election drove that prejudice from thecenter of our national life. Now, three years later, in November of 1963, he was appearingbefore the Protestant Council of New York City to reaffirm what he regarded as somefundamental truths. On that occasion, John Kennedy said: &#147;The family of man is notlimited to a single race or religion, to a single city, or country...the family of man isnearly 3 billion strong. Most of its members are not white and most of them are notChristian.&#148; And as President Kennedy reflected on that reality, he restated an idealfor which he had lived his life -- that &#147;the members of this family should be at peacewith one another.&#148;That ideal shines across all the generations of our history and allthe ages of our faith, carrying with it the most ancient dream. For as the Apostle Paulwrote long ago in Romans: &#147;If it be possible, as much as it lieth in you, livepeaceably with all men.&#148;I believe it is possible; the choice lies within us; as fellowcitizens, let us live peaceable with each other; as fellow human beings, let us strive tolive peaceably with men and women everywhere. Let that be our purpose and ourprayer, yours and mine -- for ourselves, for our country, and for all the world.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,52,"Adlai Stevenson - Speech Accepting the Democratic Presidential Nomination (26 July 1952)  Adlai StevensonSpeech Accepting   the Democratic Presidential Nomination delivered 26   July 1952 Chicago, IL   CSPAN Off Site Video of Acceptance Address[  fromaudio.]Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the convention, my fellowcitizens:I accept your nomination and your program. I should have preferred to hearthose words uttered by a stronger, a wiser, a better man than myself. But after listeningto the President's speech, I even feel better about myself. None of you, my friends,can wholly appreciate what is in my heart. I can only hope that you understand my words.They will be few.I have not sought the honor you have done me. I could not seek it,because I aspired to another office, which was the full measure of my ambition, and onedoes not treat the highest office within the gift of the people of Illinois as analternative or as a consolation prize.I would not seek your nomination for the Presidency, because theburdens of that office stagger the imagination. Its potential for good or evil, now and inthe years of our lives, smothers exultation and converts vanity to prayer.I have asked the Merciful Father -- the Father of us all -- to letthis cup pass from me, but from such dread[ed] responsibility one does not shrink in fear, inself-interest, or in false humility. So, If this cup may not pass from me, I -- except Idrink it, Thy will be done.That my heart has been troubled, that I have not sought thisnomination, that I could not seek it in good conscience, that I would not seek it inhonest self-appraisal, is not to say that I value it the less. Rather, it is that I reverethe office of the Presidency of the United States. And now, my friends, that you have madeyour decision, I will fight to win that office with all -- with all my heart and my soul. And,with your help, I have no doubt that we will win.You have summoned me to the highest mission within the gift of anypeople. I could not be more proud. Better men than I were at hand for this mighty task,and I owe to you and to them every resource of mind and of strength that I possess to makeyour deed today a good one for our country and for our Party. I am confident too, thatyour selection for -- of a candidate for Vice President will strengthen me and our Partyimmeasurably in the hard, the implacable work that lies ahead of all of us.I know you join me in gratitude and in respect for the great Democratsand the leaders of our generation whose names you have considered here in this convention,whose vigor, whose character, whose devotion to the Republic we love so well have won therespect of countless Americans and have enriched our Party. I shall need them; we shallneed them, because I have not changed in any respect since yesterday.Your nomination, awesome as I find it, has not enlarged mycapacities, so I am profoundly grateful and emboldened by their comradeship and theirfealty, and I have been deeply moved by their expressions of good will and of support. AndI cannot, my friends, resist the urge to take the one opportunity that has been affordedme to pay my humble respects to a very great and good American, whom I am proud to call mykinsman, Alben Barkley of Kentucky.Let me say, too, that I have been heartened by the conduct of thisconvention. You have argued and disagreed, because as Democrats you care and you caredeeply. But you have disagreed and argued without calling each other liars and thieves,without despoiling our best traditions -- you have not spoiled our best traditions in anynaked struggles for power.And you have written a platform that neither equivocates,contradicts, nor evades. You have restated our Party's record, its principles and itspurposes, in language that none can mistake, and with a firm confidence in justice,freedom, and peace on earth that will raise the hearts and the hopes of mankind for thatdistant day when  no -- no one rattles a saber and no one drags a chain.For all these things I am grateful to you. But I feel no exultation, nosense of triumph. Our troubles are all ahead of us. Some will call us appeasers; otherswill say that we are the war Party. Some will say we are reactionary; others will say thatwe stand for socialism. There will be inevitable -- the inevitable cries of throw therascals out, it's time for a change, and so on and so on.We'll hear all those things and many more besides. But we willhear nothing that we have not heard before. I am not too much concerned with partisandenunciation, with epithets and abuse, because the workingman, the farmer, the thoughtfulbusinessman, all know that they are better off than ever before, and they all know that the greatest danger to free enterprise in this country died with theGreat Depression under the hammer blows of the Democratic Party.And nor am I afraid that the precious two-party system is in danger.Certainly the Republican Party looked brutally alive a couple of weeks ago -- and I meanboth Republican parties. Nor am I afraid that the Democratic Party is old and fat andindolent. After a hundred and fifty years, it has been old for a long time, and it willnever be indolent, as long as it looks forward and not back, as long as it commands theallegiance of the young and the hopeful who dream the dreams and see the visions of abetter America and a better world.You will hear many sincere and thoughtful people express concernabout the continuation of one Party in power for twenty years. I don't belittle thisattitude. But change for the sake of change has no absolute merit in itself.  If our greatest hazard -- If our greatest hazard is preservation of the values of Westerncivilization, in our self-interest alone, if you please, it is the part -- is it the partof wisdom to change for the sake of change to a Party with a split personality, to aleader, whom we all respect, but who has been called upon to minister to a hopeless caseof political schizophrenia?If the fear is corruption in official position, do you believe withCharles Evans Hughes that guild is personal and knows no Party? Do you doubt the power ofany political leader, if he has the will too do so, to set his own house in order withouthis neighbors having to burn it down?What does concern me, in common with thinking partisans of bothparties, is not just winning this election but how it is won, how well we can takeadvantage of this great quadrennial opportunity to debate issues sensibly and soberly. Ihope and pray that we Democrats, win or lose, can campaign not as a crusade to exterminatethe opposing Party, as our opponents seem to prefer, but as a great opportunity toeducate and elevate a people whose destiny is leadership, not alone of a rich andprosperous, contented country, as in the past, but of a world in ferment.And, my friends even more important than winning the election isgoverning the nation. That is the test of a political party, the acid, final test. Whenthe tumult and the shouting die, when the bands are gone and the lights are dimmed, thereis the stark reality of responsibility in an hour of history haunted with those gaunt,grim specters of strife, dissension, and materialism at home and ruthless, inscrutable,and hostile power abroad.The ordeal of the twentieth century, the bloodiest, most turbulentera of the whole Christian age, is far from over. Sacrifice, patience, understanding, andimplacable purpose may be our lot for years to come. Let's face it. Let's talksense to the American people. Let's tell them the truth, that there are no gainswithout pains, that there -- that we are now on the eve of great decisions, not easydecisions, like resistance when you're attacked, but a long, patient, costly strugglewhich alone can assure triumph over the great enemies of man -- war, poverty, and tyranny-- and the assaults upon human dignity which are the most grievous consequences of each.Let's tell them that the victory to be won in the twentiethcentury, this portal to the Golden Age, mocks the pretensions of individual acumen andingenuity, for it is a citadel guarded by thick walls of ignorance and of mistrust whichdo not fall before the trumpets' blast or the politicians' imprecations or evena general's baton. They are -- They are, my friends, walls that must be directly stormedby the hosts of courage, of morality, and of vision, standing shoulder to shoulder,unafraid of ugly truth, contemptuous of lies, half truths, circuses, and demagoguery.The people are wise, wiser than the Republicans think. And theDemocratic Party is the people's Party -- not the labor Party, not the farmers' Party, not the employers' Party -- it is the Party of no one because it is the Partyof everyone.That, that, I -- I think, is our ancient mission. Where we havedeserted it, we have failed. With your help, there will be no desertion now. Better welose the election than mislead the people, and better we lose than misgovern the people.Help me to do the job in this autumn of conflict and of campaign. Help me to do the job in these years of darkness, of doubt, and of crisis which stretchbeyond the horizon of tonight's happy vision, and we will justify our glorious pastand the loyalty of silent millions who look to us for compassion, for understanding, andfor honest purpose. Thus, we will serve our great tradition greatly.I ask of you all you have. I will give you all I have, even as hewho came here tonight and honored me, as he has honored you, the Democratic Party, by alifetime of service and bravery that will find him an imperishable page in the history ofthe Republic and of the Democratic Party -- President Harry S. Truman.And finally, my friends, in this staggering task that you have assignedme, I shall always try to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with myGod.

Cox &amp; Michael E. Eidenmuller  ",,,53," Eleanor Roosevelt -- The Struggle for Human RightsEleanor RooseveltThe Struggle for Human Rights delivered 28 September 1948, Paris, France for flashI have come this evening to talk with you on one of the greatestissues of our time -- that is the preservation of human freedom. I have chosen to discussit here in France, at the Sorbonne, because here in this soil the roots of human freedomhave long ago struck deep and here they have been richly nourished. It was here theDeclaration of the Rights of Man was proclaimed, and the great slogans of the FrenchRevolution -- liberty, equality, fraternity -- fired the imagination of men. I have chosento discuss this issue in Europe because this has been the scene of the greatest historicbattles between freedom and tyranny. I have chosen to discuss it in the early days of theGeneral Assembly because the issue of human liberty is decisive for the settlement ofoutstanding political differences and for the future of the United Nations.The decisive importance of this issue was fully recognized by thefounders of the United Nations at San Francisco. Concern for the preservation andpromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms stands at the heart of the UnitedNations. Its Charter is distinguished by its preoccupation with the rights and welfare ofindividual men and women. The United Nations has made it clear that it intends to upholdhuman rights and to protect the dignity of the human personality. In the preamble to theCharter the keynote is set when it declares: We the people of the United Nationsdetermined...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth ofthe human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small,and...to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.This reflects the basic premise of the Charter that the peace and security of mankind aredependent on mutual respect for the rights and freedoms of all.One of the purposes of the United Nations is declared in article 1to be: to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of aneconomic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouragingrespect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as torace, sex, language, or religion.This thought is repeated at several points and notably in articles55 and 56 the Members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in cooperationwith the United Nations for the promotion of universal respect for, and observanceof, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex,language, or religion.The Human Rights Commission was given as its first and mostimportant task the preparation of an International Bill of Rights. The General Assembly,which opened its third session here in Paris a few days ago, will have before it the firstfruit of the Commission's labors in this task, that is the International Declaration ofHuman Rights.The Declaration was finally completed after much work during thelast session of the Human Rights Commission in New York in the spring of 1948. TheEconomic and Social Council has sent it without recommendation to the General Assembly,together with other documents transmitted by the Human Rights Commission.It was decided in our Commission that a Bill of Rights shouldcontain two parts:1. A Declaration which could be approved through action of theMember States of the United Nations in the General Assembly. This declaration would havegreat moral force, and would say to the peoples of the world this is what we hopehuman rights may mean to all people in the years to come. We have put down here therights that we consider basic for individual human beings the world over to have. Withoutthem, we feel that the full development of individual personality is impossible.2. The second part of the bill, which the Human Rights Commissionhas not yet completed because of the lack of time, is a covenant which would be in theform of a treaty to be presented to the nations of the world. Each nation, as it isprepared to do so, would ratify this covenant and the covenant would then become bindingon the nations which adhere to it. Each nation ratifying would then be obligated to changeits laws wherever they did not conform to the points contained in the covenant.This covenant, of course, would have to be a simpler document. Itcould not state aspirations, which we feel to be permissible in the Declaration. It couldonly state rights which could be assured by law and it must contain methods ofimplementation, and no state ratifying the covenant could be allowed to disregard it. Themethods of implementation have not yet been agreed upon, nor have they been given adequateconsideration by the Commission at any of its meetings. There certainly should bediscussion on the entire question of this world Bill of Human Rights and there may beacceptance by this Assembly of the Declaration if they come to agreement on it. Theacceptance of the Declaration, I think, should encourage every nation in the coming monthsto discuss its meaning with its people so that they will be better prepared to accept thecovenant with a deeper understanding of the problems involved when that is presented, wehope, a year from now and, we hope, accepted.The Declaration has come from the Human Rights Commission withunanimous acceptance except for four abstentions -- the U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia, Ukraine, andByelorussia. The reason for this is a fundamental difference in the conception of humanrights as they exist in these states and in certain other Member States in the UnitedNations.In the discussion before the Assembly, I think it should be madecrystal clear what these differences are and tonight I want to spend a little time makingthem clear to you. It seems to me there is a valid reason for taking the time today tothink carefully and clearly on the subject of human rights, because in the acceptance andobservance of these rights lies the root, I believe, of our chance of peace in the future,and for the strengthening of the United Nations organization to the point where it canmaintain peace in the future.We must not be confused about what freedom is. Basic human rightsare simple and easily understood: freedom of speech and a free press; freedom of religionand worship; freedom of assembly and the right of petition; the right of men to be securein their homes and free from unreasonable search and seizure and from arbitrary arrest andpunishment.We must not be deluded by the efforts of the forces of reaction toprostitute the great words of our free tradition and thereby to confuse the struggle.Democracy, freedom, human rights have come to have a definite meaning to the people of theworld which we must not allow any nation to so change that they are made synonymous withsuppression and dictatorship.There are basic differences that show up even in the use of wordsbetween a democratic and a totalitarian country. For instance democracy meansone thing to the U.S.S.R. and another the U.S.A. and, I know, in France. I have servedsince the first meeting of the nuclear commission on the Human Rights Commission, and Ithink this point stands out clearly.The U.S.S.R. Representatives assert that they already have achievedmany things which we, in what they call the bourgeois democracies cannotachieve because their government controls the accomplishment of these things. Ourgovernment seems powerless to them because, in the last analysis, it is controlled by thepeople. They would not put it that way -- they would say that the people in the U.S.S.R.control their government by allowing their government to have certain absolute rights. We,on the other hand, feel that certain rights can never be granted to the government, butmust be kept in the hands of the people.For instance, the U.S.S.R. will assert that their press is freebecause the state makes it free by providing the machinery, the paper, and even the moneyfor salaries for the people who work on the paper. They state that there is no controlover what is printed in the various papers that they subsidize in this manner, such, forinstance, as a trade-union paper. But what would happen if a paper were to print ideaswhich were critical of the basic policies and beliefs of the Communist government.? I amsure some good reason would be found for abolishing the paper.It is true that they have been many cases where newspapers in theU.S.S.R. have criticized officials and their actions and have been responsible for theremoval of those officials, but in doing so they did not criticize anything which wasfundamental to Communist beliefs. They simply criticized methods of doing things, so onemust differentiate between things which are permissible, such as criticism of anyindividual or of the manner of doing things, and the criticism of a belief which would beconsidered vital to the acceptance of Communism.What are the differences, for instance, between trade-unions in thetotalitarian states and in the democracies? In the totalitarian state a trade-union is aninstrument used by the government to enforce duties, not to assert rights. Propagandamaterial which the government desires the workers to have is furnished by the trade-unionsto be circulated to their members.Our trade-unions, on the other hand, are solely the instrument ofthe workers themselves. They represent the workers in their relations with the governmentand with management and they are free to develop their own opinions without governmenthelp or interference. The concepts of our trade-unions and those in totalitarian countriesare drastically different. There is little mutual understanding.I think the best example one can give of this basic difference ofthe use of terms is &#147;the right to work.&#148; The Soviet Union insists that this is abasic right which it alone can guarantee because it alone provides full employment by thegovernment. But the right to work in the Soviet Union means the assignment of workers todo whatever task is given to them by the government without an opportunity for the peopleto participate in the decision that the government should do this. A society in whicheveryone works is not necessarily a free society and may indeed be a slave society; on theother hand, a society in which there is widespread economic insecurity can turn freedominto a barren and vapid right for millions of people.We in the United States have come to realize it means freedom tochoose one&#146;s job, to work or not to work as one desires. We, in the United States,have come to realize, however, that people have a right to demand that their governmentwill not allow them to starve because as individuals they cannot find work of the kindthey are accustomed to doing and this is a decision brought about by public opinion whichcame as a result of the great depression in which many people were out of work, but wewould not consider in the United States that we had gained any freedom if we werecompelled to follow a dictatorial assignment to work where and when we were told. Theright of choice would seem to us an important, fundamental freedom.I have great sympathy with the Russian people. They love theircountry and have always defended it valiantly against invaders. They have been through aperiod of revolution, as a result of which they were for a time cut off from outsidecontact. They have not lost their resulting suspicion of other countries and the greatdifficulty is today that their government encourages this suspicion and seems to believethat force alone will bring them respect.We, in the democracies, believe in a kind of international respectand action which is reciprocal. We do not think others should treat us differently fromthe way they wish to be treated. It is interference in other countries that especiallystirs up antagonism against the Soviet Government. If it wishes to feel secure indeveloping its economic and political theories within its territory, then it should grantto others that same security. We believe in the freedom of people to make their ownmistakes. We do not interfere with them and they should not interfere with others.The basic problem confronting the world today, as I said in thebeginning, is the preservation of human freedom for the individual and consequently forthe society of which he is a part. We are fighting this battle again today as it wasfought at the time of the French Revolution and as the time of the American Revolution.The issue of human liberty is as decisive now as it was then. I want to give you myconception of what is meant in my country by freedom of the individual.Long ago in London during a discussion with Mr. Vyshinsky, he toldme there was no such things as freedom for the individual in the world. All freedom of theindividual was conditioned by the rights of other individuals. That of course, I granted.I said: &#147;We approach the question from a different point of view/ we here in theUnited Nations are trying to develop ideals which will be broader in outlook, which willconsider first the rights of man, which will consider what makes man more free; notgovernments, but man.&#148;The totalitarian state typically places the will of the peoplesecond to decrees promulgated by a few men at the top.Naturally there must always be consideration of the rights of others; but in a democracythis is not a restriction. Indeed, in our democracies we make our freedoms secure becauseeach of us is expected to respect the rights of others and we are free to make our ownlaws. Freedom for our peoples is not only a right, but also a tool. Freedom of speech,freedom of the press, freedom of information, freedom of assembly--these are not justabstract ideals to us; they are tools with which we create a way of life, a way of life inwhich we can enjoy freedom.Sometimes the processes of democracy are slow, and I have knows someof our leaders to say that a benevolent dictatorship would accomplish the ends desired ina much shorter time than it takes to go through the democratic processes of discussion andthe slow formation of public opinion. But there is no way of insuring that a dictatorshipwill remain benevolent or that power once in the hands of a few will be returned to thepeople without struggle or revolution. This we have learned by experience and we acceptthe slow processes of democracy because we know that shortcuts compromise principles onwhich no compromise is possible.The final expression of the opinion of the people with us is throughfree and honest elections, with valid choices on basic issues and candidates. The secretballot is an essential to free elections but you must have a choice before you. I haveheard my husband say many times that a people need never lose their freedom if they kepttheir right to a secret ballot and if they used that secret ballot to the full. Basicdecisions of our society are made through the expressed will of the people. That is whywhen we see these liberties threatened, instead of falling apart, our nation becomesunified and our democracies come together as a unified group in spite of our variedbackgrounds and many racial strains.In the United States we have a capitalistic economy. That is becausepublic opinion favors that type of economy under the conditions in which we live. But wehave imposed certain restraints; for instance, we have antitrust laws. These are the legalevidence of the determination of the American people to maintain an economy of freecompetition and not to allow monopolies to take away the people&#146;s freedom.Our trade-unions grow stronger because the people come to believethat this is the proper way to guarantee the rights of the workers and that the right toorganize and to bargain collectively keeps the balance between the actual producer an theinvestor of money and the manage in industry who watches over the man who works with thishands and who produces the materials which are out tangible wealth.In the United States we are old enough not to claim perfection. Werecognize that we have some problems of discrimination but we finds steady progress beingmade in the solution of these problems. Through normal democratic processes we are comingto understand our needs and how we can attain full equality for all our people. Freediscussion on the subject is permitted. Our Supreme Court has recently rendered decisionsto clarify a number of our laws to guarantee the rights of all.The U.S.S.R. claims it has reached a point where all races withinher borders are officially considered equal and have equal rights and they insist thatthey have no discrimination where minorities are concerned.This is a laudable objective but there are other aspects of thedevelopment of freedom for the individual which are essential before the mere absence ofdiscrimination is worth much, and these are lacking in the Soviet Union. Unless they arebeing denied freedoms which they want and which they see other people have, people do notusually complain of discrimination. It is these other freedoms -- the basic freedoms ofspeech, of the press, of religion and conscience, of assembly, of fair trial and freedomfrom arbitrary arrest and punishment, which a totalitarian government cannot safely giveits people and which give meaning to freedom from discrimination.It is my belief, and I am sure it is also yours, that the strugglefor democracy and freedom is a critical struggle, for their preservation is essential tothe great objective of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security.Among free men the end cannot justify the means. We know the patterns of totalitarianism-- the single political party, the control of schools, press, radio, the arts, thesciences, and the church to support autocratic authority; these are the age-old patternsagainst which men have struggled for three thousand years. These are the signs ofreaction, retreat, and retrogression. The United Nations must hold fast to the heritage offreedom won by the struggle of its people; it must help us to pass it on to generations tocome.The development of the ideal of freedom and its translation into theeveryday life of the people in great areas of the earth is the product of the efforts ofmany peoples. It is the fruit of a long tradition of vigorous thinking and courageousaction. No one race and on one people can claim to have done all the work to achievegreater dignity for human beings and great freedom to develop human personality. In eachgeneration and in each country there must be a continuation of the struggle and new stepsforward must be taken since this is preeminently a field in which to stand still its toretreat.The field of human rights is not one in which compromise onfundamental principles are possible. The work of the Commission on Human Rights isillustrative. The Declaration of Human Rights provides: &#147;Everyone has the right toleave any country, including his own.&#148; The Soviet Representative said he would agreeto this right if a single phrase was added to it --&#148;in accordance with the procedurelaid down in the laws of that country.&#148; It is obvious that to accept this would benot only to compromise but to nullify the right stated. This case forcefully illustratesthe importance of the proposition that we must ever be alert not to compromise fundamentalhuman rights merely for the sake of reaching unanimity and thus lose them.As I see it, it is not going to be easy to attain unanimity withrespect to our different concepts of government and human rights. The struggle is bound tobe difficult and one in which we must be firm but patient. If we adhere faithfully to ourprinciples I think it is possible for us to maintain freedom and to do so peacefully andwithout recourse to force.The future must see the broadening of human rights throughout theworld. People who have glimpsed freedom will never be content until they have secured itfor themselves. In a truest sense, human rights are a fundamental object of law andgovernment in a just society. Human rights exist to the degree that they are respected bypeople in relations with each other and by governments in relations with their citizens.The world at large is aware of the tragic consequences for humanbeings ruled by totalitarian systems. If we examine Hitler&#146;s rise to power, we seehow the chains are forged which keep the individual a slave and we cans e manysimilarities in the way things are accomplished in other countries. Politically men mustbe free to discuss and to arrive at as many facts as possible and there must beat least atwo-party system in a country because when there is only one political party, too manythings can be subordinated to the interests of that one party and it becomes a tyrant andnot an instrument of democratic government.The propaganda we have witnessed in the recent past, like that weperceive in these days, seeks to impugn, to undermine, and to destroy the liberty andindependence of peoples. Such propaganda poses to all peoples the issue whether to doubttheir heritage of rights and therefore to compromise the principles by which they live, ortry to accept the challenge, redouble their vigilance, and stand steadfast in the struggleto maintain and enlarge human freedoms.People who continue to be denied the respect to which they areentitled as human beings will not acquiesce forever in such denial.The Charter of the United Nations is a guiding beacon along the wayto the achievement of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. Theimmediate test is not only to the extent to which human rights and freedoms have alreadybeen achieved, but the direction in which the world is moving. Is there a faithfulcompliance with the objectives of the Charter if some countries continue to curtail humanrights and freedoms instead of to promote the universal respect for an observance of humanrights and freedoms for all as called for by the Charter?The place to discuss the issue of human rights is in the forum ofthe United Nations. The United Nations has been set up as the common meeting ground fornations, where we can consider together our mutual problems and take advantage of ourdifferences in experience. It is inherent in our firm attachment to democracy and freedomthat we stand always ready to use the fundamental democratic procedures of honestdiscussion and negotiation. It is now as always our hope that despite the wide differencesin approach we face in the world today, we can with mutual good faith in the principles ofthe united Nations Charter, arrive at a common basis of understanding.We are here to join the meetings of this great internationalAssembly which meets in your beautiful capital of Paris. Freedom for the individual is aninseparable part of the cherished traditions of France. As one of the Delegates from theUnited States, I pray Almighty God that we may win another victory here for the rights andfreedoms of all men.Book/CDs by Michael E.

I stand before you to proclaim tonight:America is the land where dreams can come true for all of us. As I standbefore the American people and think of the honor this great conventionhas bestowed upon me, I recall the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,who made America stronger by making America more free. He said, ""Occasionallyin life there are moments which cannot be completely explained by words.Their meaning can only be articulated by the inaudible language of theheart."" Tonight is such a moment for me.My heart is filled with pride. My fellow citizens, I proudly acceptyour nomination for Vice President of the United States.  And I am proud to run with a man who will be one of the great Presidentsof this century, Walter F. Mondale. Tonight, the daughter of a woman whosehighest goal was a future for her children talks to our nation's oldestparty about a future for us all. Tonight, the daughter of working Americanstells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willingto reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has beenchosen to run for [Vice] President in the new land my father came to love.  Our faith that we can shape a better future is what the American dreamis all about. The promise of our country is that the rules are fair. Ifyou work hard and play by the rules, you can earn your share of America'sblessings. Those are the beliefs I learned from my parents. And those arethe values I taught my students as a teacher in the public schools of NewYork City.At night, I went to law school. I became an assistant district attorney,and I put my share of criminals behind bars. I believe if you obey thelaw, you should be protected. But if you break the law, you must pay foryour crime.When I first ran for Congress, all the political experts said a Democratcould not win my home district in Queens. I put my faith in the peopleand the values that we shared. Together, we proved the political expertswrong. In this campaign, Fritz Mondale and I have put our faith in thepeople. And we are going to prove the experts wrong again. We are goingto win. We are going to win because Americans across this country believein the same basic dream.Last week, I visited Elmore, Minnesota, the small town where Fritz Mondalewas raised. And soon Fritz and Joan will visit our family in Queens. Ninehundred people live in Elmore. In Queens, there are 2,000 people on oneblock. You would think we'd be different, but we're not. Children walkto school in Elmore past grain elevators; in Queens, they pass by subwaystops. But, no matter where they live, their future depends on education,and their parents are willing to do their part to make those schools asgood as they can be. In Elmore, there are family farms; in Queens, smallbusinesses. But the men and women who run them all take pride in supportingtheir families through hard work and initiative. On the 4th of July inElmore, they hang flags out on Main Street; in Queens, they fly them overGrand Avenue. But all of us love our country, and stand ready to defendthe freedom that it represents.Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration,the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right thatevery year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up,while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.The rules say: Everyone in our society should contribute their fair share.It isn't right that this year Ronald Reagan will hand the American peoplea bill for interest on the national debt larger than the entire cost ofthe federal government under John F. Kennedy. Our parents left us a growingeconomy. The rules say: We must not leave our kids a mountain of debt.It isn't right that a woman should get paid 59 cents on the dollar forthe same work as a man.If you play by the rules, you deserve a fair day's pay for a fair day'swork. It isn't right that, if trends continue, by the year 2000 nearlyall of the poor people in America will be women and children. The rulesof a decent society say: When you distribute sacrifice in times of austerity,you don't put women and children first. It isn't right that young peopletoday fear they won't get the Social Security they paid for, and that olderAmericans fear that they will lose what they have already learned [earned]. SocialSecurity is a contract between the last generation and the next, and therules say: You don't break contracts.We are going to keep faith with older Americans. We hammered out a faircompromise in the Congress to save Social Security. Every group sacrificedto keep the system sound. It is time Ronald Reagan stopped scaring oursenior citizens.It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring childreninto a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more thantwo centuries. And our future doesn't have to be that way. Change is inthe air, just as surely as when John Kennedy beckoned America to a newfrontier; when Sally Ride rocketed into space; and when Reverend JesseJackson ran for the office of President of the United States.  By choosing a woman to run for our nation's second highest office, yousend a powerful signal to all Americans: There are no doors we cannot unlock.We will place no limits on achievement. If we can do this, we can do anything.  Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of Americanlife work fairly for all Americans again. To an Administration that wouldhave us debate all over again whether the Voting Rights Act should be renewedand whether segregated schools should be tax exempt, we say, Mr. President:Those debates are over. On the issue of civil rights, voting rights, andaffirmative action for minorities, we must not go backwards. We must --and we will -- move forward to open the doors of opportunity.  To those who understand that our country cannot prosper unless we drawon the talents of all Americans, we say: We will pass the Equal RightsAmendment.The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can dofor America.  To the Americans who will lead our country into the 21st century, wesay: We will not have a Supreme Court that turns the clock back to the19th century.To those concerned about the strength of American and family values,as I am, I say: We are going to restore those values -- love, caring, partnership-- by including, and not excluding, those whose beliefs differ from ourown. Because our own faith is strong, we will fight to preserve the freedomof faith for others.To those working Americans who fear that banks, utilities, and largespecial interests have a lock on the White House, we say: Join us; let'select the people's President; and let's have government by and for the Americanpeople again.To an Administration that would savage student loans and education atthe dawn of a new technological age, we say: You fit the classic definitionof a cynic; you know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.  To our students and their parents, we say: We will insist on the higheststandards of excellence, because the jobs of the future require skilledminds. To young Americans who may be called to our country's service, wesay: We know your generation will proudly answer our country's call, aseach generation before you.This past year, we remembered the bravery and sacrifice of Americansat Normandy. And we finally paid tribute -- as we should have done yearsago -- to that Unknown Soldier who represents all the brave young Americanswho died in Vietnam. Let no one doubt, we will defend America's securityand the cause of freedom around the world. But we want a President whotells us what America's fighting for, not just what we are fighting against.  We want a President who will defend human rights, not just where itis convenient, but wherever freedom is at risk -- from Chile to Afghanistan,from Poland to South Africa. To those who have watched this administration'sconfusion in the Middle East, as it has tilted first toward one and thenanother of Israel's long-time enemies and wonder: ""Will America stand byher friends and sister democracy?"" we say: America knows who her friendsare in the Middle East and around the world. America will stand with Israelalways.Finally, we want a President who will keep America strong, but use thatstrength to keep America and the world at peace. A nuclear freeze is nota slogan: It is a tool for survival in the nuclear age. If we leave ourchildren nothing else, let us leave them this Earth as we found it: wholeand green and full of life.I know in my heart that Walter Mondale will be that President.  A wise man once said, ""Every one of us is given the gift of life, andwhat a strange gift it is. If it is preserved jealously and selfishly,it impoverishes and saddens. But if it is spent for others, it enrichesand beautifies."" My fellow Americans: We can debate policies and programs,but in the end what separates the two parties in this election campaignis whether we use the gift of life for others or only ourselves.  Tonight, my husband, John, and our three children are in this hall withme. To my daughters, Donna and Laura, and my son, John Junior, I say: Mymother did not break faith with me, and I will not break faith with you.  To all the children of America, I say: The generation before ours keptfaith with us, and like them, we will pass on to you a stronger, more justAmerica.Thank you.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,55," Robert La Follette - Free Speech in Wartime Robert La FolletteSenate Address on Free Speech in War Time Title delivered 6 October 1917, U.S. Senate Chamber, Washington, D.C. for flashMr. President, I rise to a question of personal privilege.I have no intention of taking the time of the Senate with a review of the events which led to our entrance into the war except in so far as they bear upon the question of personal privilege to which I am addressing myself.Six Members of the Senate and 50 Members of the House voted against the declaration of war. Immediately there was let loose upon those Senators and Representatives a flood of invective and abuse from newspapers and individuals who had been clamoring for war, unequaled, I believe, in the history of civilized society.Prior to the declaration of war every man who had ventured to oppose our entrance into it had been condemned as a coward or worse, and even the President had by no means been immune from these attacks.Since the declaration of war the triumphant war press has pursued those Senators and Representations who voted against war with malicious falsehood and recklessly libelous attacks, going to the extreme limit of charging them with treason against their country.This campaign of libel and character assassination directed against the Members of Congress who opposed our entrance into the war has been continued down to the present hour, and I have upon my desk newspaper clippings, some of them libels upon me alone, some directed as well against other Senators who voted in opposition to the declaration of war.One of these newspaper reports most widely circulated represents a Federal judge in the State of Texas as saying, in a charge to a grand jury -- I read the article as it appeared in the newspaper and the headline with which it is introduced:DISTRICT JUDGE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE SHOT AT TRAITORS IN CONGRESS.[By Associated Press leased wire.]Houston, Texas., October 1,1917Judge Waller T. Burns, of the United States district court, in charging a Federal grand jury at the beginning of the October term today, after calling by name Senators STONE of Missouri, HARDWICK of Georgia, VARDAMAN of Mississippi, GRONNA of North Dakota, GORE of Oklahoma, and LAFOLLETTE of Wisconsin, said:If I had a wish, I would wish that you men had jurisdiction to return bills of indictment against these men. They ought to be tried promptly and fairly, and I believe this court could administer the law fairly; but I have a conviction, as strong as life, that this country should stand them up against an adobe wall tomorrow and give them what they deserve. If any man deserves death, it is a traitor. I wish that I could pay for the ammunition. I would like to attend the execution, and if I were in the firing squad I would not want to be the marksman who had the blank shell.The above clipping, Mr. President, was sent to me by another Federal judge, who wrote upon the margin of the clipping that it occurred to him that the conduct of this judge might very properly be the subject of investigation. He enclosed with the clipping a letter, from which I quote the following:I have been greatly depressed by the brutal and unjust attacks that great business interests have organized against you. It is a time when all the spirits of evil are turned loose. The Kaisers of high finance, who have been developing hatred of you for a generation because you have fought against them and for the common good, see this opportunity to turn the war patriotism into an engine of attack. They are using it everywhere, and it is a day when lovers of democracy, not only in the world, but here in the United States, need to go apart on the mountain and spend the night in fasting and prayer. I still have faith that the forces of good on this earth will be found to be greater than the forces of evil, but we all need resolution. I hope you will have the grace to keep your center of gravity on the inside of you and to keep a spirit that is unclouded by hatred. It is a time for the words, with malice toward none and charity for all. It is the office of great service to be a shield to the good man's character against malice. Before this fight is over you will have a new revelation that such a shield is yours.If this newspaper clipping were a single or exceptional instance of lawless defamation. I should not trouble the Senate with a reference to it. But Mr. President, it is not.In this mass of newspaper clippings which I have here upon my desk, and which I shall not trouble the Senate to read unless it is desired, and which represent but a small part of the accumulation clipped from the daily press of the country in the last three months, I find other Senators, as well as myself, accused of the highest crimes of which any man can be guilty --treason and disloyalty -- and, sir, accused not only with no evidence to support the accusation, but without the suggestion that such evidence anywhere exists. It is not claimed that Senators who opposed the declaration of war have since that time acted with any concerted purpose either regarding war measured or any others. They have voted according to their individual opinions, have often been opposed to each other on bills which have come before the Senate since the declaration of war, and, according to my recollection, have never all voted together since that time upon any single proposition upon which the Senate has been divided. I am aware, Mr. President that in pursuance of this general campaign of vilification and attempted intimidation, requests from various individuals and certain organizations have been submitted to the Senate for my expulsion from this body, and that such requests have been referred to and considered by one of the committees of the Senate.If I alone had been made the victim of these attacks, I should not take one moment of the Senate's time for their consideration, and I believe that other Senators who have been unjustly and unfairly assailed, as I have been, hold the same attitude upon this that I do. Neither the clamor of the mob nor the voice of power will ever turn me by the breadth of a hair from the course I mark out for myself, guided by such knowledge as I can obtain and controlled and directed by a solemn conviction of right and duty.But, sir, it is not alone Members of Congress that the war party in this country has sought to intimidate. The mandate seems to have gone forth to the sovereign people of this country that they must be silent while those things are being done by their Government which most vitally concern their well-being, their happiness, and their lives. Today and for weeks past honest and law-abiding citizens of this country are being terrorized and outraged in their rights by those sworn to uphold the laws and protect the rights of the people. I have in my possession numerous affidavits establishing the fact that people are being unlawfully arrested, thrown into jail, held incommunicado for days, only to be eventually discharged without ever having been taken into court, because they have committed no crime. Private residences are being invaded, loyal citizens of undoubted integrity and probity arrested, cross-examined, and the most sacred constitutional rights guaranteed to every American citizen are being violated.It appears to be the purpose of those conducting this campaign to throw the country into a state of terror, to coerce public opinion, to stifle criticism, and suppress discussion of the great issues involved in this war.I think all men recognize that in time of war the citizen must surrender some rights for the common good which he is entitled to enjoy in time of peace. But sir, the right to control their own Government according to constitutional forms is not one of the rights that the citizens of this country are called upon to surrender in time of war.Rather in time of war the citizen must be more alert to the preservation of his right to control his Government. He must be most watchful of the encroachment of the military upon the civil power. He must beware of those precedents in support of arbitrary action by administrative officials, which excused on the plea of necessity in war time, become the fixed rule when the necessity has passed and normal conditions have been restored.More than all, the citizen and his representative in Congress in time of war must maintain his right of free speech. More than in time of war must maintain his right of free speech. More than in times of peace it is necessary that the channels for free public discussion of governmental policies shall be open and unclogged. I believe, Mr. President, that I am now touching upon the most important question in this country today -- and that is the right of the citizens of this country and their representatives in Congress to discuss in an orderly way frankly and publicly and without fear, from the platform and through the press, every important phase of this war; its causes, the manner in which it should be conducted, and the terms upon which peace should be made. The belief which is becoming wide spread in this land that this most fundamental right is being denied to the citizens of this country is a fact the tremendous significance of which, those in authority have not yet begun to appreciate. I am contending, Mr. President, for the great fundamental right of the sovereign people of this country to make their voice heard and have that voice heeded upon the great questions arising out of this war, including not only how the war shall be prosecuted but the conditions upon which it may be terminated with a due regard for the rights and the honor of this Nation and the interests of humanity.I am contending for this right because the exercise of it is necessary to the welfare, to the existence, of this Government to the successful conduct of this war, and to a peace which shall be enduring and for the best interest of this country.Suppose success attends the attempt to stifle all discussion of the issues of this war, all discussion of the terms upon which it should be concluded, all discussion of the objects and purposes to be accomplished by it, and concede the demand of the war-mad press and war extremists that they monopolize the right of public utterance upon these questions unchallenged, what think you would be the consequences to this country not only during the war but after the war?RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO DISCUSS WAR ISSUES.Mr. President, our Government, above all others, is founded on the right of the people freely to discuss all matters pertaining to their Government, in war not less than in peace, for in this Government the people are the rulers in war no less than in peace. It is true, sir, that Members of the House of Representatives are elected for two years, the President for four years, and the Members of the Senate for six years, and during their temporary official terms these officers constitute what is called the Government. But back of them always is the controlling sovereign power of the people, and when the people can make their will known, the faithful officer will obey that will. Though the right of the people to express their will by ballot is suspended during the term of office of the elected official, nevertheless the duty of the official to obey the popular will continues throughout this entire term of office. How can that popular will express itself between elections except by meetings, by speeches, by publications, by petitions, and by addresses to the representatives of the people? Any man who seeks to set a limit upon those rights, whether in war or peace, aims a blow at the most vital part of our Government. And then as the time for election approaches and the official is called to account for his stewardship -- not a day, not a week, not a month, before the election, but a year or more before it, if the people choose -- they must have the right to the freest possible discussion of every question upon which their representative has acted, of the merits of every measure he has supported or opposed, of every vote he has cast and every speech that he has made. And before this great fundamental right every other must, if necessary, give way, for in no other manner can representative government be preserved.Mr. President, what I am saying has been exemplified in the lives and public discussion of the ablest statesman of this country, whose memories we most revere and whose deeds, we most justly commemorate. I shall presently ask the attention of the Senate to the views of some of these men upon the subject we are now considering.Closely related to this subject of the right of the citizen to discuss war is that of the constitutional power and duty of the Congress to declare the purposes and objects of any war in which our country may be engaged. The authorities which I shall cite cover both the right of the people to discuss the war in all its phases and the right and the duty of the people's representatives in Congress to declare the purposes and objects of the war. For the sake of brevity, I shall present these quotations together at this point instead of submitting them separately.DISCUSSION BY AMERICAN STATESMEN.Henry Clay, in a memorable address at Lexington, Kentucky., on the 13th day of November, 1847, during the Mexican War, took a strong position in behalf of the right of the people to freely discuss every question relating to the war, even though the discussion involved a strong condemnation of the war policy of the Executive. He also declared it to be not only the right but the duty of the Congress to declare the objects of the war. AS a part of that address he presented certain resolutions embodying his views on these subjects. These resolutions were adopted at that meeting by the people present, and were adopted at many other mass meetings throughout the country during the continuance of the Mexican War.For introducing in this body some time ago a resolution asserting the right of Congress to declare the purposes of the present war, I have, as the newspaper clippings here will show, been denounced as a traitor and my conduct characterized as treasonable.As bearing directly upon the conduct for which I have been so criticized and condemned, I invite your attention to the language of Henry Clay in the address I have mentioned.He said:But the havoc of war is in progress and the no less deplorable havoc of an inhospitable and pestilential climate. Without indulging in an unnecessary retrospect and useless reproaches on the past, all hearts and heads should unite in the patriotic endeavor to bring it to a satisfactory close. Is there no way that this can be done? Must we blindly continue the conflict without any visible object or any prospect of a definite termination? This is the important subject upon which I desire to consult and to commune with you. Who in this free Government is to decide upon the objects of a war at its commencement of at any time during its existence? Does the power belong to collective wisdom of the Nation in congress assembled, or is it vested solely in a single functionary of the Government?A declaration of war is the highest and most awful exercise of sovereignty. The convention which framed our Federal constitution had learned from the pages of history that it had been often and greatly abused. It had seen that war had often been commenced upon the most trifling pretexts; that it had been frequently waged to establish or exclude a dynasty; to snatch a crown from the head of one potentate and place it upon the head of another; that it had often been prosecuted to promote alien and other interests than those of the nation whose chief had proclaimed it, as in the case of English wars for Hanoverian interests; and, in short, that such a vast and tremendous power ought not to be confined to the perilous exercise of one single man. The convention therefore resolved to guard the war-making power against those great abuses, of which, in the hands of a monarch, it was so susceptible. And the security against those abuses which its wisdom devised was to vest the war-making power in the congress of the united States, being the immediate representatives of the people and the States. So apprehensive and jealous was the convention of its abuse in any State in the Union without the consent of Congress. Congress, then in our system of government, is the sole depository of that tremendous power.Mr. President, it is impossible for me to quote as extensively from this address as I should like to do and still keep within the compass of the time that I have set down for myself; but the whole of the address is accessible to every Senator here, together with all of the discussion which followed it over the country, and in these times it would seem to me worthy of the review of Senators and of newspaper editors and of those who have duties to discharge in connection with this great crisis that is upon the world.I quote further:The Constitution provides that Congress shall have power to declare war and grant letters of marque and reprisal, to make rules concerning captures on land and water, to raise and support armies, and provide and maintain a navy, and to make rules for the government of the land and naval forces. Thus we perceive that the principal power, in regard to war, with all its auxiliary attendants, is granted to Congress. Whenever called upon to determine upon the solemn question of peace or war, Congress must consider and deliberate and decide upon the motives, objects, and causes of the war.If that be true is it treason for a Senator upon this floor to offer a resolution dealing with that question?I quote further from Mr. Clay:And, if a war be commenced without any previous declaration of its objects, as in the case of the existing war with Mexico, Congress must necessarily possess the authority, at any time, to declare for what purposes it shall be further prosecuted. If we suppose Congress does not possess the controlling authority attributed to it, if it be contended that a war having been once commenced, the President of the United States may direct it to the accomplishment of any object he pleases, without consulting and without any regard to the will of Congress, the convention will have utterly failed in guarding the Nation against the abuses and ambition of a single individual. Either Congress or the President possess if and may prosecute it for objects against the will of Congress, where is the difference between our free Government and that of any other nation which may be governed by an absolute Czar, Emperor, or King?In closing his address Mr. Clay said:I conclude, therefore, Mr. President and fellow citizens, with entire confidence, that congress has the right, either at the beginning or during the prosecution of any war, to decide the objects and purposes for which it was proclaimed or for which it ought to be continued. And I think it is the duty of congress, by some deliberate and authentic act to declare for what objects the present war shall be longer prosecuted. I suppose the President would not hesitate to regulate his conduct by the pronounced will of congress and to employ the force and the diplomatic power of the Nation to execute that will. But is the President should decline or refuse to do so and, in contempt of the supreme authority of congress, should persevere, in waging the war for other objects than those proclaimed by Congress, then it would be the imperative duty of that body to vindicate its authority by the most stringent and effectual and appropriate measures. And it, on the contrary, the enemy should refuse to conclude a treaty containing stipulations securing the objects designated by Congress, it would become the duty of the whole Government to prosecute the war with all the national energy until those objects were attained by a treaty of peace. There can be no insuperable difficulty in Congress making such an authoritative declaration. Let it resolve, simply, that the war shall or shall not be a war of conquest; and, if a war of conquest, what is to be conquered. should a resolution pass disclaiming the design of conquest, peace would follow in less than 60 days, if the President would conform to his constitutional duty.Mr. Clay as a part of that speech presented certain resolutions which were unanimously adopted by the meeting and which declared that the power to determine the purposes of the war rested with Congress, and then proceeded clearly to state the purposes, and the only purposes, for which the war should be prosecuted.The last one of these resolutions is so pertinent to the present discussion that I invite your attention to it at this time. It is as follows:Resolved, That we invite our fellow citizens of the United States who are anxious for the restoration of the blessings of peace, or, it the existing war shall continue to be prosecuted, are desirous that its purposes and objects shall be defined and know, who are anxious to avert present and future perils and dangers, with which it may be fraught, and who are also anxious to produce contentment and satisfaction at home, and to elevate the national character abroad, to assemble together in their respective communities, and to express their views, feelings, and opinions.Abraham Lincoln was a Member of congress at the time of the Mexican War. He strongly opposed the war while it was in progress and severely criticized President Polk on the floor of the House because he did not state in his message when peace might be expected. In the course of his speech Lincoln said:At its beginning, Gen. Scott was by this same President driven into disfavor, if not disgrace, for intimating that peace could not be conquered in less than three or four months. But now, at the end of 20 months * * * this same President gives a long message, without showing us that as to the end he himself has even an imaginary conception. AS I have said, he knows not where he is. He is a bewildered, confounded, and miserably perplexed man. God grant he may be able to show there is not something about his conscience more painful than his mental perplexity.Writing to a friend who had objected to his opposition to Polk in relation to this power of the President in war, Lincoln said:The provision of the constitution giving the war-making power to Congress was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons: Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions, and they resolved to so frame the constitution that no man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us. But your view destroys the whole matter and places our President where kings have always stood.I now quote from the speech of Charles Sumner,  delivered at Tremont Temple, Boston, November 5, 1846. John A. Andrew, who was the great war governor of Massachusetts, as I remember, presided at this public meeting, which was in support of the independent nomination of Dr. I.G. Howe as Representative in Congress. Mr. Sumner was followed by Hon. Charles Francis Adams, who also  delivered an address at this meeting. This is the view of Mr. Sumner on the Mexican War, which was then in progress, as expressed by him on this occasion:The Mexican War is an enormity born of slavery. * * * Base in object, atrocious in beginning, immoral in all its influences, vainly prodigal of treasure and life, it is a war of infamy, which must blot the pages of our history.In closing his eloquent and powerful address, he said:Even if we seem to fail in this election we shall not fail in reality. The influence of this effort will help to awaken and organize that powerful public opinion by which this war will at last be arrested. Hand out, fellow citizens, the white banner of peace; let the citizens of Boston rally about it; and may it be borne forward by and enlightened, conscientious people, aroused to condemnation of this murderous war, until Mexico, now wet with blood unjustly shed, shall repose undisturbed beneath its folds.Contrast this position taken by Charles Sumner at Tremont Temple with that of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. McAdoo. He is now touring the country with all the prestige of his great financial mission and the authority of his great financial mission and the authority of his high place in the administration. I quote the language of the authorized report of his speech before the Bankers' Association of West Virginia, September 21, 1917. According to daily press reports he is making substantially the same denunciation in all his addresses:America intends that those well-meaning but misguided people who talk inopportunity of peace when there can be no peace until the cancer which has rotted civilization in Europe is extinguished and destroyed forever shall be silenced. I want to say here and now and with due deliberation that every pacifist speech in this country made at this inopportune and improper time is in effect traitorous.In these times we had better turn the marble bust of Charles Sumner to the wall. It ill becomes those who tamely surrender the right of free speech to look upon that strong, noble, patriotic face.Mr. President, Daniel Webster, then in the zenith of his power, and with the experience and knowledge of his long life and great public service in many capacities, to add weight to his words, spoke at Faneuil Hall, November 6, 1846, in opposition to the Mexican War. He said:Mr. Chairman, I wish to speak with all soberness in this respect, and I would say nothing here tonight which I would not say in my place in Congress or before the whole world. The question now is, For what purposes and to what ends is this present war to be prosecuted!What will you say to the stature of the statesmanship that imputes treason to his country to a Member of this body who introduces a resolution having no other import than that?Webster saw no reason why the purposes of the war in which his country was engaged should not be discussed in Congress or out of congress by the people's representatives or by the people themselves.After referring to Mexico as a weak and distracted country he proceeded:It is time for us to know what are the objects and designs of our Government. It is not the habit of the American people, nor natural to their character, to consider the expense of a war which they deem just and necessary...Not only just, but necessary...but it is their habit and belongs to their character to inquire into the justice and necessity of a war in which it is proposed to involve them.Mr. Webster discussed the Mexican War at Springfield, Mass., September 29, 1847, and again, while the war was in progress, he did not hesitate to express his disapproval in plain language.Many battles had been fought and won, and our victorious armies were in the field, on foreign soil.Sir, free speech had not been suppressed. The right of the people to assemble and to state their grievances was still an attribute of American freedom. Mr. Webster said: We are, in my opinion, in a most unnecessary and therefore a most unjustifiable war.Whoever expects to whip men, free men, in this country into a position where they are to be denied the right to exercise the same freedom of speech and discussion that Webster exercised in that speech little understand the value which the average citizen of this country places upon the liberty guaranteed to him by the Constitution. Sir, until the sacrifices of every battle field consecrated to the establishment of representative government and of constitutional freedom shall be obliterated from the pages of history and forgotten of men, the plain citizenship of this country will jealously guard that liberty and that freedom and will not surrender it.To return to my text. Mr. Webster said:We are in my opinion, in a most unnecessary and therefore a most unjustifiable war. I hope we are nearing the close of it. I attend carefully and anxiously to every rumor and every breeze that brings to us any report that the effusion of blood, caused, in my judgment, by a rash and unjustifiable proceeding on the part of the Government, may cease.He makes the charge that the war was begun under false pretexts, as follows:Now, sir, the law of nations instructs us that there are wars of pretexts. The history of the world proves that there have been, and we are not now without proof that there are, wars waged on pretexts; that is, on pretenses, where the cause assigned is not the true cause. That I believe on my conscience is the true character of the war now waged against Mexico. IF believe it to be a war of pretexts; a war in which the true motive is not distinctly avowed, but in which pretenses, afterthoughts, evasions, and other method are employed to put a case before the community which is not the true case.Think you Mr. Webster was not within his constitutional rights in thus criticizing the character of the war, its origin and the reasons which were given from time to time in justification of it?Mr. Webster discusses at length what he considers some of the false pretexts of the war. Later on he says:Sir, men there are whom we see and whom we hear speak of the duty of extending our free institutions over the whole world if possible. We owe it to benevolence, they think, to confer the blessings we enjoy on every other people. But while I trust that liberty and free civil institutions, as we have experienced them, may ultimately spread over the globe, I am by no means sure that all people are fit for them: nor am I desirous of imposing, or forcing, our peculiar forms upon any nation that does not wish to embrace them.Taking up the subject that war does now exist, Mr. Webster asks:What is our duty? I say for one, that I suppose it to be true -- I hope it to be true -- that a majority of the next House of Representatives will be Whigs; will be opposed to the war. I think we have heard from the East and the West, the North and the South, some things that make that pretty clear. Suppose it to be so. What then? Well, sir, I say for one, and at once, that unless the President of the United States shall make out a case which shall show to congress that the aim and object for which the war is now prosecuted is no purpose not connected with the safety of the Union and the just rights of the American people, then Congress ought to pass resolutions against the prosecution of the war, and grant no further supplies. I would speak here with caution and all just limitation. It must be admitted to be the clear intent of the constitution that no foreign war would exist without the assent of Congress. This was meant as a restraint on the Executive power. But, if, when a war has once begun, the President may continue it as long as he pleases, free of all control of Congress, then it is clear that the war power is substantially in his own single hand. Nothing will be done by a wise Congress hastily or rashly, nothing that partakes of the nature of violence or recklessness; a high and delicate regard must, of course, be had for the honor and credit of the Nation; but, after all, if the war should become odious to the people, if they shall disapprove the objects for which it appears to be prosecuted, then it will be the bounden duty of their Representatives in Congress to demand of the President a full statement of his objects and purposes. And if these purposes shall appear to them not to be founded in the public good, or not consistent with the honor and character of the country, then it will be their duty to put an end to it by the exercise of their constitutional authority. If this be not so, then the whole balance of the Constitution is overthrown, and all just restraint on the Executive power, in a matter of the highest concern to the peace and happiness of the country is over thrown, and all just restraint on the Executive power, in a matter of the highest concern to the peace and happiness of the country, entirely destroyed. If we do not maintain this doctrine; if it is not so -- if Congress, in whom the war-making power is expressly made to reside, is to have no voice in the declaration or continuance or war; if it is not to judge of the propriety of beginning or carrying it on -- then we depart at on",,,56,"Ronald Reagan -- 40th Anniversary of D-Day Address  Ronald ReaganRemarkson the 40th Anniversary of D-Day delivered 6 June 1984 in Pointe Du Hoc, Normandy, France);  "", ""ronaldrreagandday4534592."");   ; for flash[  fromaudio. (2)]We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied armies joinedin battle to reclaim this continent to liberty. For four long years, muchof Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free nations had fallen, Jewscried out in the camps, millions cried out for liberation. Europe was enslavedand the world prayed for its rescue. Here, in Normandy, the rescue began.Here, the Allies stood and fought against tyranny, in a giant undertakingunparalleled in human history.We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of France.The air is soft, but forty years ago at this moment, the air was densewith smoke and the cries of men, and the air was filled with the crackof rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At dawn, on the morning of the 6thof June, 1944, two hundred and twenty-five Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and ranto the bottom of these cliffs. Their mission was one of the most difficultand daring of the invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs andtake out the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiestof these guns were here, and they would be trained on the beaches to stopthe Allied advance.  The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers at the edge of thecliffs, shooting down at them with machine guns and throwing grenades. Andthe American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope ladders over the faceof these cliffs and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell,another would take his place. When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grabanother and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back, and held theirfooting. Soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top,and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began toseize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five came here.After two days of fighting, only ninety could still bear arms.  And behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that werethrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the men who putthem there. These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. And these are the heroes who helped end a war. Gentlemen, I look at you and I thinkof the words of Stephen Spender's poem. You are men who in your ""livesfought for life and left the vivid air signed with your honor."" I think I know what you may be thinking right now --thinking ""we werejust part of a bigger effort; everyone was brave that day."" Well everyonewas. Do you remember the story of Bill Millin of the 51st Highlanders?Forty years ago today, British troops were pinned down near a bridge, waitingdesperately for help. Suddenly, they heard the sound of bagpipes, and somethought they were dreaming. Well, they weren't. They looked up and sawBill Millin with his bagpipes, leading the reinforcements and ignoringthe smack of the bullets into the ground around him. Lord Lovat was with him -- Lord Lovat of Scotland, who calmly announcedwhen he got tothe bridge, ""Sorry, I'm a few minutes late,"" as if he'd been delayed bya traffic jam, when intruth he'd just come from the bloody fighting on Sword Beach, which heand his men had just taken. There was the impossible valor of the Poles, who threw themselves betweenthe enemyand the rest of Europe as the invasion took hold; and the unsurpassed courageof theCanadians who had already seen the horrors of war on this coast. They knewwhat awaitedthem there, but they would not be deterred. And once they hit Juno Beach,they neverlooked back.All of these men were part of a roll call of honor with names that spokeof a pride as brightas the colors they bore; The Royal Winnipeg Rifles, Poland's 24th Lancers,the RoyalScots' Fusiliers, the Screaming Eagles, the Yeomen of England's armoreddivisions, theforces of Free France, the Coast Guard's ""Matchbox Fleet,"" and you, theAmericanRangers.Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here. You wereyoung the dayyou took these cliffs; some of you were hardly more than boys, with thedeepest joys of lifebefore you. Yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? Whatimpelled you toput aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to takethese cliffs? Whatinspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at you, and somehowwe know the answer. It was faith and belief. It was loyalty and love.  The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faiththat they foughtfor all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on thisbeachhead, or on thenext. It was the deep knowledge -- and pray God we have not lost it -- thatthere is a profoundmoral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use offorce for conquest.You were here to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those othersdid not doubt yourcause. And you were right not to doubt.You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's country is worthdying for, anddemocracy is worth dying for, because it's the most deeply honorable formof governmentever devised by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willingto fight tyranny, and youknew the people of your countries were behind you.  The Americans who fought here that morning knew word of the invasion was spreading through the darkness back home. They fought -- or felt in their hearts, though they couldn't know in fact, that in Georgia they were filling the churches at 4:00 am. In Kansas they werekneeling on their porches and praying. And in Philadelphia they were ringingthe Liberty Bell.Something else helped the men of D-day; their rock-hard belief that Providencewould havea great hand in the events that would unfold here; that God was an allyin this great cause.And so, the night before the invasion, when Colonel Wolverton asked hisparachute troopsto kneel with him in prayer, he told them: Do not bow your heads, but lookup so you cansee God and ask His blessing in what we're about to do. Also, that night,General Matthew Ridgway on his cot, listening in the darkness for the promise God madeto Joshua: ""I willnot fail thee nor forsake thee.""These are the things that impelled them; these are the things that shapedthe unity of theAllies.When the war was over, there were lives to be rebuilt and governments tobe returned tothe people. There were nations to be reborn. Above all, there was a newpeace to beassured. These were huge and daunting tasks. But the Allies summoned strengthfrom thefaith, belief, loyalty, and love of those who fell here. They rebuilt anew Europe together.There was first a great reconciliation among those who had been enemies,all of whom hadsuffered so greatly. The United States did its part, creating the MarshallPlan to help rebuildour allies and our former enemies. The Marshall Plan led to the Atlanticalliance -- a greatalliance that serves to this day as our shield for freedom, for prosperity,and for peace.In spite of our great efforts and successes, not all that followed theend of the war washappy or planned. Some liberated countries were lost. The great sadnessof this lossechoes down to our own time in the streets of Warsaw, Prague, and EastBerlin. The Soviettroops that came to the center of this continent did not leave when peacecame. They'restill there, uninvited, unwanted, unyielding, almost forty years afterthe war. Because of this,allied forces still stand on this continent. Today, as forty years ago,our armies are here foronly one purpose: to protect and defend democracy. The only territorieswe hold arememorials like this one and graveyards where our heroes rest.  We in America have learned bitter lessons from two world wars. It is betterto be here readyto protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushingto respond only afterfreedom is lost. We've learned that isolationism never was and never willbe an acceptableresponse to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent.But we try always to be prepared for peace, prepared to deter aggression,prepared tonegotiate the reduction of arms, and yes, prepared to reach out again inthe spirit ofreconciliation. In truth, there is no reconciliation we would welcome morethan areconciliation with the Soviet Union, so, together, we can lessen the risksof war, now andforever.It's fitting to remember here the great losses also suffered by the Russianpeople duringWorld War II. Twenty million perished, a terrible price that testifies to allthe world the necessityof ending war. I tell you from my heart that we in the United States donot want war. Wewant to wipe from the face of the earth the terrible weapons that man nowhas in his hands.And I tell you, we are ready to seize that beachhead. We look for somesign from the SovietUnion that they are willing to move forward, that they share our desireand love for peace,and that they will give up the ways of conquest. There must be a changingthere that willallow us to turn our hope into action.We will pray forever that someday that changing will come. But for now,particularly today, itis good and fitting to renew our commitment to each other, to our freedom,and to thealliance that protects it.We're bound today by what bound us   40 years ago, the same loyalties,traditions, andbeliefs. We're bound by reality. The strength of America's allies is vitalto the United States,and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedomof Europe's democracies. We were with you then; we're with you now. Your hopes areour hopes, andyour destiny is our destiny.Here, in this place where the West held together, let us make a vow toour dead. Let usshow them by our actions that we understand what they died for. Let ouractions say tothem the words for which Matthew Ridgway listened: ""I will not fail theenor forsake thee.""Strengthened by their courage and heartened by their value [valor] and borne by theirmemory, let uscontinue to stand for the ideals for which they lived and died.  Thank you very much, and God bless you all.  Book/CDs by Michael E.

KennedyAddress to the People of Massachusetts on Chappaquiddick broadcast nationally from Joseph P. Kennedy's home on 25 July 1969);  "", ""tedkennedychappaquiddickspeech."");   ; My fellow citizens: I have requested this opportunity to talk to the people ofMassachusetts about the tragedy which happened last Friday evening. This morning I entereda plea of guilty to the charge of leaving the scene of an accident. Prior to my appearancein court it would have been improper for me to comment on these matters. But tonight I amfree to tell you what happened and to say what it means to me.On the weekend of July 18th, I was on Martha's Vineyard Islandparticipating with my nephew, Joe Kennedy -- as for thirty years my family hasparticipated -- in the annual Edgartown Sailing Regatta. Only reasons of health preventedmy wife from accompanying me.On Chappaquiddick Island, off Martha's Vineyard, I attended, onFriday evening, July 18th, a cook-out I had encouraged and helped sponsor for a devoted groupof Kennedy campaign secretaries. When I left the party, around 11:15pm, I wasaccompanied by one of these girls, MissMary Jo Kopechne. Mary Jo was one of the mostdevoted members of the staff of Senator Robert Kennedy. She worked for him for four yearsand was broken up over his death. For this reason, and because she was such a gentle,kind, and idealistic person, all of us tried to help her feel that she still had a homewith the Kennedy family.  Mary Jo KopechneThere is no truth, no truth whatever, to the widely circulatedsuspicions of immoral conduct that have been leveled at my behavior and hers regardingthat evening. There has never been a private relationship between us of any kind. I knowof nothing in Mary Jo's conduct on that or any other occasion -- and the same is true of theother girls at that party -- that would lend any substance to such ugly speculation abouttheir character. Nor was I driving under the influence of liquor.Little over one mile away, the car that I was driving on an unlitroad went off a narrow bridge which had no guard rails and was built on a left angle to theroad. The car overturned in a deep pond and immediately filled with water. I rememberthinking as the cold water rushed in around my head that I was for certain drowning. Thenwater entered my lungs and I actual felt the sensation of drowning. But somehow Istruggled to the surface alive.I made immediate and repeated efforts to save Mary Jo by diving intothe strong and murky current, but succeeded only in increasing my state of utter exhaustionand alarm. My conduct and conversations during the next several hours, to the extent thatI can remember them, make no sense to me at all.Although my doctors informed me that I suffered a cerebralconcussion, as well as shock, I do not seek to escape responsibility for my actions byplacing the blame either on the physical and emotional trauma brought on by the accident, oron anyone else.I regard as indefensible the fact that I did not report the accident tothe police immediately.Instead of looking directly for a telephone after lying exhausted inthe grass for an undetermined time, I walked back to the cottage where the party was beingheld and requested the help of two friends, my cousin, Joseph Gargan and Phil Markham, anddirected them to return immediately to the scene with me -- this was sometime aftermidnight -- in order to undertake a new effort to dive down and locate Miss Kopechne.Their strenuous efforts, undertaken at some risk to their own lives, also proved futile.All kinds of scrambled thoughts -- all of them confused, some ofthem irrational, many of them which I cannot recall, and some of which I would not haveseriously entertained under normal circumstances -- went through my mind during thisperiod. They were reflected in the various inexplicable, inconsistent, and inconclusivethings I said and did, including such questions as whether the girl might still be alivesomewhere out of that immediate area, whether some awful curse did actually hang over allthe Kennedys, whether there was some justifiable reason for me to doubt what had happenedand to delay my report, whether somehow the awful weight of this incredible incidentmight in some way pass from my shoulders. I was overcome, I'm frank to say, by a jumbleof emotions: grief, fear, doubt, exhaustion, panic, confusion, and shock.Instructing Gargan and Markham not to alarm Mary Jo's friends thatnight, I had them take me to the ferry crossing. The ferry having shut down for the night,I suddenly jumped into the water and impulsively swam across, nearly drowning once againin the effort, and returned to my hotel about 2:00am -- and collapsed in my room. I remember going out at one point and saying something to the roomclerk.In the morning, with my mind somewhat more lucid, I made an effortto call a family legal advisor, Burke Marshall, from a public telephone on theChappaquiddick side of the ferry and then belatedly reported the accident to the Martha['s]Vineyard police.Today, as I mentioned, I felt morally obligated to plead guilty tothe charge of leaving the scene of an accident. No words on my part can possibly expressthe terrible pain and suffering I feel over this tragic incident. This last week has beenan agonizing one for me and for the members of my family. And the grief we feel over the lossof a wonderful friend will remain with us the rest of our lives.These events, the publicity, innuendo, and whispers which havesurrounded them and my admission of guilt this morning raises the question in my mind ofwhether my standing among the people of my State has been so impaired that I should resignmy seat in the United States Senate. If at any time the citizens of Massachusetts shouldlack confidence in their Senator's character, or his ability -- with or withoutjustification -- he could not in my opinion adequately perform his duties and should notcontinue in office.The people of this State, the State which sent John Quincy Adams,and Daniel Webster, and Charles Sumner, and Henry Cabot Lodge, and John Kennedy to theUnited States Senate are entitled to representation in that body by men who inspire theirutmost confidence. For this reason, I would understand full well why some might think itright for me to resign. For me, this will be a difficult decision to make.It has been seven years since my first election to the Senate. Youand I share many memories -- some of them have been glorious, some have been very sad. Theopportunity to work with you and serve Massachusetts has made my life worthwhile.And so I ask you tonight, the people of Massachusetts, to think thisthrough with me. In facing this decision, I seek your advice and opinion. In making it, Iseek your prayers -- for this is a decision that I will have finally to make on my own.It has been written:A man does what he must -- in spite of personalconsequences, in spite of obstacles, and dangers, and pressures -- and that is the basis ofall human morality.1...whatever may be the sacrifices he faces, if he follows his conscience --the loss of his friends, his fortune, his contentment, even the esteem of his fellow man-- each man must decide for himself the course he will follow. The stories of the pastcourage cannot supply courage itself. For this, each man must look into his own soul.2I pray that I can have the courage to make the right decision.Whatever is decided, whatever the future holds for me, I hope that I shall have -- beable to put this most recent tragedy behind me and make some further contribution to ourstate and mankind -- whether it be in public or private life.Thank you and good night.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Lewis - Labor and the Nation  John L. LewisLabor and the Nation delivered 3 September 1937 in Washington D.C. for flashOut of the agony and travail of economic America the Committee forIndustrial Organization was born. To millions of Americans exploited without stint bycorporate industry and socially debased beyond the understanding of the fortunate, itscoming was as welcomed as the dawn to the night watcher. To a lesser group of Americans,infinitely more fortunately situated, blessed with larger quantities of the world&#146;sgoods and insolent in their assumption of privilege, its coming was heralded as aharbinger of ill, sinister of purpose, of unclean methods and non-virtuous objectives. Butthe Committee for Industrial Organizations is here. It is now henceforth a definiteinstrumentality, destined greatly to influence the lives of our people and the internaland external course of the republic.This is true only because the purposes and objectives of theCommittee for Industrial Organization find economic, social, political and moraljustification in the hearts of the millions who are its members and the millions more whosupport it. The organization and constant onward sweep of this movement exemplifies theresentment of the many toward the selfishness, greed and the neglect of the few.The workers of the nation were tired of waiting for corporateindustry to right their economic wrongs, to alleviate their social agony and to grant themtheir political rights. Despairing of fair treatment, they resolved to do something forthemselves. They, therefore, have organized a new labor movement, conceived within theprinciples of the national bill of rights and committed to the proposition that theworkers are free to assemble in their own forums, voice their own grievances, declaretheir own hopes and contract on even terms with modern industry for the sale of their onlymaterial possession -- their labor.The Committee for Industrial Organization has a numerical enrollmentof 3,718,000 members. It has 32 affiliated national and international unions. Of thisnumber 11 unions account for 2,765,000 members. This group is organized in the textile,auto, garment, lumber, rubber, electrical manufacturing, power, steel, coal and transportindustries. The remaining membership exists in the maritime, oil production and refining,ship building, leather, chemical, retail, meat packing, vegetable canning, metalliferousmining, miscellaneous manufacturing, agricultural labor, and service and miscellaneousindustries. Some 200,000 workers are organized into 507 chartered local unions not yetattached to a national industrial union.This record bespeaks progress. It is a development without precedentin our own country. Some of this work was accomplished with the enlightened cooperation orthe tolerant acquiescence of employers who recognized that a new labor movement was beingforged and who were not disposed, in any event, to flout the law of the land. On the otherhand, much of this progress was made in the face of violent and deadly opposition whichreached its climax in the slaughter of workers paralleling the massacres of Ludlow andHomestead.In the steel industry the corporations generally have acceptedcollective bargaining and negotiated wage agreements with the Committee for IndustrialOrganization. Eighty-five per cent of the industry is thus under contract and a peacefulrelationship exits between the management and the workers. Written wage contracts havebeen negotiated with 399 steel companies covering 510,000 men. One thousand thirty-onelocal lodges in 700 communities have been organized.Five of the corporations in the steel industry elected to resistcollective bargaining and undertook to destroy the steel workers' union. These companiesfilled their plants with industrial spies, assembled depots of guns and gas bombs,established barricades, controlled their communities with armed thugs, leased the policepower of cities and mobilized the military power of a state to guard them against theintrusion of collective bargaining within their plants.During this strike 18 steel workers were either shot to death or hadtheir brains clubbed out by police, or armed thugs in the pay of the steel companies. InChicago, Mayor Kelly's police force was successful in killing ten strikers before theycould escape the fury of the police, shooting eight of them in the back. One hundred sixtystrikers were maimed and injured by police clubs, riot guns and gas bombs and werehospitalized. Hundreds of strikers were arrested, jailed, treated with brutalitywhile incarcerated and harassed by succeeding litigation. None but strikers were murdered,gassed, injured, jailed or maltreated. No one had to die except the workers who werestanding for the right guaranteed them by the Congress and written in the law.The infamous Governor Davey, of Ohio, successful in the lastelection because of his reiterated promises of fair treatment to labor, used the militarypower of the Commonwealth on the side of the Republican Steel Company and the YoungstownSheet and Tube Company. Nearly half of the staggering military expenditure incident to thecrushing of this strike in Ohio was borne by the federal government through the allocationof financial aid to the military establishment of the state.The steel workers have now buried their dead, while the widows weepand watch their orphaned children become objects of public charity. The murder of theseunarmed men has never been publicly rebuked by any authoritative officer of the state orfederal government. Some of them, in extenuation, plead lack of jurisdiction, but murderas a crime against the moral code can always be rebuked without regard to the niceties oflegalistic jurisdiction by those who profess to be the keepers of the public conscience.Shortly after Kelly's police force in Chicago had indulged in theirbloody orgy, Kelly came to Washington looking for political patronage. That patronage wasforthcoming and Kelly must believe that the killing of the strikers is no liability inpartisan politics.Meanwhile, the steel puppet Davey is still Governor of Ohio, but notfor long I think - not for long. The people of Ohio may be relied upon to mete ourpolitical justice to one who has betrayed his state, outraged the public conscience andbesmirched the public honor.While the men of the steel industry were going through blood and gasin defense of their rights and their homes and their families, elsewhere on the far-flungC.I.O. front the hosts of labor were advancing and intelligent and permanent progress wasbeing made. In scores of industries plant after plant and company after company werenegotiating sensible working agreements.The men in the steel industry who sacrificed their all were normerely aiding their fellows at home but were adding strength to the cause of theircomrades in all industry. Labor was marching toward the goal of industrial democracy andcontributing constructively toward a more rational arrangement of our domestic economy.Labor does not see industrial strife. It wants peace, but a peacewith justice. In the long struggle for labor&#146;s rights it has been patient andforbearing. Sabotage and destruction syndicalism have had no part in the American labormovement. Workers have kept faith in American institutions. Most of the conflicts, whichhave occurred have been when labor&#146;s right to live has been challenged and denied.If there is to be peace in our industrial life let the employerrecognize his obligation to his employees -- at least to the degree set forth in existingstatutes. Ordinary problems affecting wages, hours, and working conditions, in mostinstances, will quickly respond to negotiation in the council room.The United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association ofManufacturers, and similar groups representing industry and financial interests, arerendering a disservice to the American people in their attempts to frustrate theorganization of labor and in their refusal to accept collective bargaining as one of oureconomic institutions.These groups are encouraging a systematic organization of vigilantegroups to fight unionization under the sham pretext of local interests. They equip thesevigilantes with tin hats, wooden clubs, gas masks and lethal weapons and train them in thearts of brutality and oppression. They bring in snoops, finks, hatchet gangs andChowderhead Cohens to infest their plants and disturb the communities.Fascist organizations have been launched and financed under theshabby pretext that the C.I.O. movement is communistic. The real breeders of discontentand alien doctrines of government and philosophies subversive of good citizenship are suchas these who take the law into their own hands.No tin-hat brigade of goose-stepping vigilantes or bibble-babblingmob of blackguarding and corporation paid scoundrels will prevent the onward march oflabor, or divert its purpose to play its natural and rational part in the development ofthe economic, political and social life of our nation.Unionization, as opposed to communism, presupposes the relation ofemployment; it is based upon the wage system and it recognizes fully and unreservedly theinstitution of private property and the right to investment profit. It is upon the fullerdevelopment of collective bargaining, the wider expansion of the labor movement, theincreased influence of labor in our national councils, that the perpetuity of ourdemocratic institutions must largely depend.The organized workers of America, free in their industrial life,conscious partners in production, secure in their homes and enjoying a decent standard ofliving, will prove the finest bulwark against the intrusion of alien doctrines ofgovernment. Do those who have hatched this foolish cry of communism in theC.I.O. fear the increased influence of labor in our democracy? Do they fear its influencewill be cast on the side of shorter hours, a better system of distributed employment,better homes for the under-privileged, social security for the aged, a fairer distributionof the national income?Certainly the workers that are being organized want a voice in thedetermination of these objectives of social justice. Certainly labor wants a fairer sharein the national income. Assuredly labor wants a larger participation in increasedproductive efficiency. Obviously the population is entitled to participate in the fruitsof the genius of our men of achievement in the field of the material sciences.Labor has suffered just as our farm population has suffered from aviciously unequal distribution of the national income. In the exploitation of both classesof workers has been the source of panic and depression, and upon the economic welfare ofboth rests the best assurance of a sound and permanent prosperity.In this connection let me call attention to the propaganda whichsome of our industrialists are carrying on among the farmers. By pamphlets in the milkcans or attached to machinery and in countless other ways of direct and indirect approach,the farmers of the nation are being told that the increased price of farm machinery andfarm supplies is due to the rising wage level brought about by the Committee forIndustrial Organization. And yet it is the industrial millions of this country whoconstitute the substantial market for all agricultural products.The interest of the two groups are mutually dependent. It is whenthe pay roll goes down that the farmer's realization is diminished, so that his loansbecome overdue at the bank and the arrival of the tax collector is awaited with fear. Onthe other hand it is the prosperity of the farmer that quickness the tempo ofmanufacturing activities and brings buying power to the millions of urban and industrialworkers.As we view the years that have passed this has always been true andit becomes increasingly imperative that the farm population and the millions of workers inindustry must learn to combine their strength for the attainment of mutual and desirableobjectives and at the same time learn to guard themselves against the sinister propagandaof those who would divide and exploit them.Under the banner of the Committee for Industrial OrganizationAmerican labor is on the march. Its objectives today are those it had in the beginning: tostrive for the unionization of our unorganized millions of workers and for the acceptanceof collective bargaining as a recognized American institution.It seeks peace with the industrial world. It seeks cooperation andmutuality of effort with the agricultural population. It would avoid strikes. It wouldhave its rights determined under the law by the peaceful negotiations and contractrelationships that are supposed to characterize American commercial life.Until an aroused public opinion demands that employers accept thatrule, labor has no recourse but to surrender its rights or struggle for their realizationwith its own economic power.The objectives of this movement are not political in a partisansense. Yet it is true that a political party which seeks the support of labor and makespledges of good faith to labor must, in equity and good conscience, keep that faith andredeem those pledges.The spectacle of august and dignified members of Congress, servantsof the people and agents of the republic, skulking in hallways and closets, hiding theirfaces in a party caucus to prevent a quorum from acting upon a labor measure, is one thatemphasizes the perfidy of politicians and blasts the confidence of labor's millions inpolitician's promises and statesmen's vows.Labor next year cannot avoid the necessity of a political assay ofthe work and. deeds of its so-called friends and its political beneficiaries. It mustdetermine who are its friends in the arena of politics as elsewhere. It feels that itscause is just and that its friends should not view its struggle with neutral detachment orintone constant criticism of its activities.Those who chant their praises of democracy but who lose no chance todrive their knives into labor's defenseless back must feel the weight of labor's woe evenas its open adversaries must ever feel the thrust of labor's power.Labor, like Israel, has many sorrows. Its women weep for theirfallen and they lament for the future of the children of the race. It ill behooves one whohas supped at labor's table and who has been sheltered in labor's house to curse withequal fervor and fine impartiality both labor and its adversaries when they become lockedin deadly embrace.I repeat that labor seeks peace and guarantees its own loyalty, butthe voice of labor, insistent upon its rights, should not be annoying to the ears ofjustice or offensive to the conscience of the American people.Text Source: This version taken from John Llewellyn Lewis&#146;, The John L.Lewis papers, 1879-1969, published in 1979, by Microfilming Corporation of America:Sanford, N.C.Image Source: WikipediaCopyright Status: Text = Uncertain.

",,,59," Barry Goldwater -- Speech Accepting the Republican Presidential NominationBarry GoldwaterSpeech Accepting the Republican Presidential Nomination delivered 16 July 1964, San Francisco  );  "", ""barrygoldwater1964rnc."");   ; for flashMy good friend and great Republican, Dick Nixon, and your charming wife, Pat; my running mate, that wonderful Republican who has served us so well for so long, Bill Miller and his wife, Stephanie; to Thurston Morton who's done such a commendable job in chairmaning this Convention; to Mr. Herbert Hoover, who I hope is watching; and to that -- that great American and his wife, General and Mrs. Eisenhower; to my own wife, my family, and to all of my fellow Republicans here assembled, and Americans across this great Nation.From this moment, united and determined, we will go forward together, dedicated to the ultimate and undeniable greatness of the whole man. Together -- Together we will win.I accept your nomination with a deep sense of humility. I accept, too, the responsibility that goes with it, and I seek your continued help and your continued guidance. My fellow Republicans, our cause is too great for any man to feel worthy of it. Our task would be too great for any man, did he not have with him the hearts and the hands of this great Republican Party, and I promise you tonight that every fiber of my being is consecrated to our cause; that nothing shall be lacking from the struggle that can be brought to it by enthusiasm, by devotion, and plain hard work.In this world no person, no Party can guarantee anything, but what we can do and what we shall do is to deserve victory, and victory will be ours.The good Lord raised this mighty Republic to be a home for the brave and to flourish as the land of the free -- not to stagnate in the swampland of collectivism, not to cringe before the bullying of communism.Now, my fellow Americans, the tide has been running against freedom. Our people have followed false prophets. We must, and we shall, return to proven ways -- not because they are old, but because they are true. We must, and we shall, set the tides running again in the cause of freedom. And this party, with its every action, every word, every breath, and every heartbeat, has but a single resolve, and that is freedom -- freedom made orderly for this Nation by our constitutional government; freedom under a government limited by the laws of nature and of nature's God; freedom balanced so that order lacking liberty [sic] will not become the slavery of the prison shell [cell]; balanced so that liberty lacking order will not become the license of the mob and of the jungle.Now, we Americans understand freedom. We have earned it; we have lived for it, and we have died for it. This Nation and its people are freedom's model in a searching world. We can be freedom's missionaries in a doubting world. But, ladies and gentlemen, first we must renew freedom's mission in our own hearts and in our own homes.During four futile years, the administration which we shall replace has -- has distorted and lost that vision. It has talked and talked and talked and talked the words of freedom, but it has failed and failed and failed in the works of freedom.Now, failures cement the wall of shame in Berlin. Failures blot the sands of shame at the Bay of Pigs. Failures mark the slow death of freedom in Laos. Failures infest the jungles of Vietnam. And failures haunt the houses of our once great alliances and undermine the greatest bulwark ever erected by free nations -- the NATO community. Failures proclaim lost leadership, obscure purpose, weakening will, and the risk of inciting our sworn enemies to new aggressions and to new excesses. And because of this administration we are tonight a world divided; we are a Nation becalmed. We have lost the brisk pace of diversity and the genius of individual creativity. We are plodding along at a pace set by centralized planning, red tape, rules without responsibility, and regimentation without recourse.Rather than useful jobs in our country, our people have been offered bureaucratic make work; rather than moral leadership, they have been given bread and circuses. They have been given spectacles, and, yes, they've even been given scandals. Tonight, there is violence in our streets, corruption in our highest offices, aimlessness amongst our youth, anxiety among our elders, and there's a virtual despair among the many who look beyond material success for the inner meaning of their lives. And where examples of morality should be set, the opposite is seen. Small men, seeking great wealth or power, have too often and too long turned even the highest levels of public service into mere personal opportunity.Now, certainly, simple honesty is not too much to demand of men in government. We find it in most. Republicans demand it from everyone. They demand it from everyone no matter how exalted or protected his position might be. Now the -- the growing menace in our country tonight, to personal safety, to life, to limb and property, in homes, in churches, on the playgrounds, and places of business, particularly in our great cities, is the mounting concern, or should be, of every thoughtful citizen in the United States.Security from domestic violence, no less than from foreign aggression, is the most elementary and fundamental purpose of any government, and a government that cannot fulfill this purpose is one that cannot long command the loyalty of its citizens.History shows us -- it demonstrates that nothing, nothing prepares the way for tyranny more than the failure of public officials to keep the streets safe from bullies and marauders.Now, we Republicans see all this as more, much more, than the result of mere political differences or mere political mistakes. We see this as the result of a fundamentally and absolutely wrong view of man, his nature, and his destiny. Those who seek to live your lives for you, to take your liberties in return for relieving you of yours, those who elevate the state and downgrade the citizen must see ultimately a world in which earthly power can be substituted for Divine Will, and this Nation was founded upon the rejection of that notion and upon the acceptance of God as the author of freedom.Now those who seek absolute power, even though they seek it to do what they regard as good, are simply demanding the right to enforce their own version of heaven on earth. They -- and let me remind you, they are the very ones who always create the most hellish tyrannies. Absolute power does corrupt, and those who seek it must be suspect and must be opposed. Their mistaken course stems from false notions, ladies and gentlemen, of equality. Equality, rightly understood, as our founding fathers understood it, leads to liberty and to the emancipation of creative differences. Wrongly understood, as it has been so tragically in our time, it leads first to conformity and then to despotism.Fellow Republicans, it is the cause of Republicanism to resist concentrations of power, private or public, which -- which enforce such conformity and inflict such despotism. It is the cause of Republicanism to ensure that power remains in the hands of the people. And, so help us God, that is exactly what a Republican President will do with the help of a Republican Congress.It is further the cause of Republicanism to restore a clear understanding of the tyranny of man over man in the world at large. It is our cause to dispel the foggy thinking which avoids hard decisions in the delusion that a world of conflict will somehow mysteriously resolve itself into a world of harmony, if we just don't rock the boat or irritate the forces of aggression -- and this is hogwash.It is further the cause of Republicanism to remind ourselves, and the world, that only the strong can remain free, that only the strong can keep the peace.Now, I needn't remind you, or my fellow Americans regardless of party, that Republicans have shouldered this hard responsibility and marched in this cause before. It was Republican leadership under Dwight Eisenhower that kept the peace, and passed along to this administration the mightiest arsenal for defense the world has ever known. And I needn't remind you that it was the strength and the [un]believable will of the Eisenhower years that kept the peace by using our strength, by using it in the Formosa Straits and in Lebanon and by showing it courageously at all times.It was during those Republican years that the thrust of Communist imperialism was blunted. It was during those years of Republican leadership that this world moved closer, not to war, but closer to peace, than at any other time in the last three decades.And I needn't remind you -- but I will -- that it's been during Democratic years that our strength to deter war has stood still, and even gone into a planned decline. It has been during Democratic years that we have weakly stumbled into conflict, timidly refusing to draw our own lines against aggression, deceitfully refusing to tell even our people of our full participation, and tragically, letting our finest men die on battlefields, unmarked by purpose, unmarked by pride or the prospect of victory.Yesterday, it was Korea. Tonight, it is Vietnam. Make no bones of this. Don't try to sweep this under the rug. We are at war in Vietnam. And yet the President, who is the Commander-in-Chief of our forces, refuses to say -- refuses to say, mind you, whether or not the objective over there is victory. And his Secretary of Defense continues to mislead and misinform the American people, and enough of it has gone by.And I needn't remind you -- but I will -- it has been during Democratic years that a billion persons were cast into Communist captivity and their fate cynically sealed.Today -- Today in our beloved country we have an administration which seems eager to deal with communism in every coin known -- from gold to wheat, from consulates to confidences, and even human freedom itself.Now the Republican cause demands that we brand communism as the principal disturber of peace in the world today. Indeed, we should brand it as the only significant disturber of the peace, and we must make clear that until its goals of conquest are absolutely renounced and its relations with all nations tempered, communism and the governments it now controls are enemies of every man on earth who is or wants to be free.Now, we here in America can keep the peace only if we remain vigilant and only if we remain strong. Only if we keep our eyes open and keep our guard up can we prevent war. And I want to make this abundantly clear: I don't intend to let peace or freedom be torn from our grasp because of lack of strength or lack of will -- and that I promise you, Americans.I believe that we must look beyond the defense of freedom today to its extension tomorrow. I believe that the communism which boasts it will bury us will, instead, give way to the forces of freedom. And I can see in the distant and yet recognizable future the outlines of a world worthy of our dedication, our every risk, our every effort, our every sacrifice along the way. Yes, a world that will redeem the suffering of those who will be liberated from tyranny. I can see -- and I suggest that all thoughtful men must contemplate -- the flowering of an Atlantic civilization, the whole of Europe reunified and freed, trading openly across its borders, communicating openly across the world. Now, this is a goal far, far more meaningful than a moon shot.It's a -- It's a truly inspiring goal for all free men to set for themselves during the latter half of the twentieth century. I can also see -- and all free men must thrill to -- the events of this Atlantic civilization joined by its great ocean highway to the United States. What a destiny! What a destiny can be ours to stand as a great central pillar linking Europe, the Americas, and the venerable and vital peoples and cultures of the Pacific. I can see a day when all the Americas, North and South, will be linked in a mighty system, a system in which the errors and misunderstandings of the past will be submerged one by one in a rising tide of prosperity and interdependence. We know that the misunderstandings of centuries are not to be wiped away in a day or wiped away in an hour. But we pledge, we pledge that human sympathy -- what our neighbors to the South call an attitude of simpatico -- no less than enlightened self'-interest will be our guide.And I can see this Atlantic civilization galvanizing and guiding emergent nations everywhere.Now I know this freedom is not the fruit of every soil. I know that our own freedom was achieved through centuries, by unremitting efforts of brave and wise men. And I know that the road to freedom is a long and a challenging road. And I know also that some men may walk away from it, that some men resist challenge, accepting the false security of governmental paternalism.And I -- And I pledge that the America I envision in the years ahead will extend its hand in health, in teaching and in cultivation, so that all new nations will be at least encouraged -- encouraged! -- to go our way, so that they will not wander down the dark alleys of tyranny or the dead-end streets of collectivism.My fellow Republicans, we do no man a service by hiding freedom's light under a bushel of mistaken humility. I seek an America proud of its past, proud of its ways, proud of its dreams, and determined actively to proclaim them. But our example to the world must, like charity, begin at home. In our vision of a good and decent future, free and peaceful, there must be room, room for deliberation of the energy and the talent of the individual; otherwise our vision is blind at the outset. We must assure a society here which, while never abandoning the needy or forsaking the helpless, nurtures incentives and opportunities for the creative and the productive. We must know the whole good is the product of many single contributions. And I cherish a day when our children once again will restore as heroes the sort of men and women who, unafraid and undaunted, pursue the truth, strive to cure disease, subdue and make fruitful our natural environment and produce the inventive engines of production, science, and technology. This Nation, whose creative people have enhanced this entire span of history, should again thrive upon the greatness of all those things which we, we as individual citizens, can and should do. And during Republican years, this again will be a nation of men and women, of families proud of their role, jealous of their responsibilities, unlimited in their aspirations -- a Nation where all who can will be self-reliant. We Republicans see in our constitutional form of government the great framework which assures the orderly but dynamic fulfillment of the whole man, and we see the whole man as the great reason for instituting orderly government in the first place. We see -- We see in private property and in economy based upon and fostering private property, the one way to make government a durable ally of the whole man, rather than his determined enemy. We see in the sanctity of private property the only durable foundation for constitutional government in a free society. And -- And beyond that, we see, in cherished diversity of ways, diversity of thoughts, of motives and accomplishments. We don't seek to lead anyone's life for him. We only seek -- only seek to secure his rights, guarantee him opportunity -- guarantee him opportunity to strive, with government performing only those needed and constitutionally sanctioned tasks which cannot otherwise be performed. We Republicans seek a government that attends to its inherent responsibilities of maintaining a stable monetary and fiscal climate, encouraging a free and a competitive economy and enforcing law and order. Thus, do we seek inventiveness, diversity, and creative difference within a stable order, for we Republicans define government's role where needed at many, many levels -- preferably, though, the one closest to the people involved. Our towns and our cities, then our counties, then our states, then our regional compacts -- and only then, the national government. That, let me remind you, is the ladder of liberty, built by decentralized power. On it also we must have balance between the branches of government at every level. Balance, diversity, creative difference: These are the elements of the Republican equation. Republicans agree -- Republicans agree heartily to disagree on many, many of their applications, but we have never disagreed on the basic fundamental issues of why you and I are Republicans.This is a Party. This Republican Party is a Party for free men, not for blind followers, and not for conformists.In fact, in 1858 Abraham Lincoln said this of the Republican party -- and I quote him, because he probably could have said it during the last week or so: It was composed of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements -- end of the quote -- in 1858. Yet -- Yet all of these elements agreed on one paramount objective: To arrest the progress of slavery, and place it in the course of ultimate extinction.Today, as then, but more urgently and more broadly than then, the task of preserving and enlarging freedom at home and of safeguarding it from the forces of tyranny abroad is great enough to challenge all our resources and to require all our strength.Anyone who joins us in all sincerity, we welcome. Those who do not care for our cause, we don't expect to enter our ranks in any case. And -- And let our Republicanism, so focused and so dedicated, not be made fuzzy and futile by unthinking and stupid labels.I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.Why the beauty of the very system we Republicans are pledged to restore and revitalize, the beauty of this Federal system of ours is in its reconciliation of diversity with unity. We must not see malice in honest differences of opinion, and no matter how great, so long as they are not inconsistent with the pledges we have given to each other in and through our Constitution.Our Republican cause is not to level out the world or make its people conform in computer regimented sameness. Our Republican cause is to free our people and light the way for liberty throughout the world.Ours is a very human cause for very humane goals.This Party, its good people, and its unquenchable devotion to freedom, will not fulfill the purposes of this campaign, which we launch here and now, until our cause has won the day, inspired the world, and shown the way to a tomorrow worthy of all our yesteryears.I repeat, I accept your nomination with humbleness, with pride, and you and I are going to fight for the goodness of our land.

",,,60,"Stokely Carmichael - Black Power   Stokely CarmichaelBlack Power Address at UC Berkeley delivered October 1966, Berkeley, CA/**/ for flashThank you very much. ItåÕs a privilege and an honor to be in the white intellectual ghetto of the West. We wanted to do a couple of things before we started. The first is that, based on the fact thatSNCC, through the articulation of its program by its chairman, has been able to win elections in Georgia, Alabama, Maryland, and by our appearance here will win an election in California, in 1968 I'm going to run for President of the United States. I just can't make it, 'cause I wasn't born in the United States. That's the only thing holding me back.We wanted to say that this is a student conference, as it should be, held on a campus, and that we're not ever to be caught up in the intellectual masturbation of the question of Black Power. ThatåÕs a function of people who are advertisers that call themselves reporters. Oh, for my members and friends of the press, my self-appointed white critics, I was reading Mr. Bernard Shaw two days ago, and I came across a very important quote which I think is most apropos for you. He says, All criticism is a[n] autobiography. Dig yourself. Okay.The philosophers Camus and Sartre raise the question whether or not a man can condemn himself. The black existentialist philosopher who is pragmatic,Frantz Fanon, answered the question. He said that man could not. Camus and Sartre was not. We in SNCC tend to agree with Camus and Sartre, that a man cannot condemn himself.å_ Were he to condemn himself, he would then have to inflict punishment upon himself. An example would be the Nazis. Any prisoner who -- any of the Nazi prisoners who admitted, after he was caught and incarcerated, that he committed crimes, that he killed all the many people that he killed, he committed suicide. The only ones who were able to stay alive were the ones who never admitted that they committed a crimes [sic] against people -- that is, the ones who rationalized that Jews were not human beings and deserved to be killed, or that they were only following orders.On a more immediate scene, the officials and the population -- the white population -- in Neshoba County, Mississippi -- thatåÕs where Philadelphia is -- could not -- could not condemn [Sheriff] Rainey, his deputies, and the other fourteen men that killed three human beings. They could not because they elected Mr. Rainey to do precisely what he did; and that for them to condemn him will be for them to condemn themselves.In a much larger view, SNCC says that white America cannot condemn herself. And since we are liberal, we have done it: You stand condemned. Now, a number of things that arises from that answer of how do you condemn yourselves. Seems to me that the institutions that function in this country are clearly racist, and that they're built upon racism. And the question, then, is how can black people inside of this country move? And then how can white people who say theyåÕre not a part of those institutions begin to move? And how then do we begin to clear away the obstacles that we have in this society, that make us live like human beings? How can we begin to build institutions that will allow people to relate with each other as human beings? This country has never done that, especially around the country of white or black.Now, several people have been upset because weåÕve said that integration was irrelevant when initiated by blacks, and that in fact it was a subterfuge, an insidious subterfuge, for the maintenance of white supremacy. Now we maintain that in the past six years or so, this country has been feeding us a thalidomide drug of integration, and that some negroes have been walking down a dream street talking about sitting next to white people; and that that does not begin to solve the problem; that when we went to Mississippi we did not go to sit next to Ross Barnettå_; we did not go to sit next to Jim Clarkå_; we went to get them out of our way; and that people ought to understand that; that we were never fighting for the right to integrate, we were fighting against white supremacy. Now, then, in order to understand white supremacy we must dismiss the fallacious notion that white people can give anybody their freedom. No man can give anybody his freedom. A man is born free. You may enslave a man after he is born free, and that is in fact what this country does. It enslaves black people after theyåÕre born, so that the only acts that white people can do is to stop denying black people their freedom; that is, they must stop denying freedom. They never give it to anyone. Now we want to take that to its logical extension, so that we could understand, then, what its relevancy would be in terms of new civil rights bills. I maintain that every civil rights bill in this country was passed for white people, not for black people. For example, I am black. I know that. I also know that while I am black I am a human being, and therefore I have the right to go into any public place. White people didn't know that. Every time I tried to go into a place they stopped me. So some boys had to write a bill to tell that white man, HeåÕs a human being; donåÕt stop him. That bill was for that white man, not for me. I knew it all the time. I knew it all the time.I knew that I could voteand that that wasnåÕt a privilege; it was my right. Every time I tried I was shot, killed or jailed, beaten or economically deprived. So somebody had to write a bill for white people to tell them, When a black man comes to vote, donåÕt bother him. That bill, again, was for white people, not for black people; so that when you talk about open occupancy, I know I can live anyplace I want to live. It is white people across this country who are incapable of allowing me to live where I want to live. You need a civil rights bill, not me. I know I can live where I want to live.So that the failures to pass a civil rights bill isnåÕt because of Black Power, isn't because of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee; it's not because of the rebellions that are occurring in the major cities. It is incapability of whites to deal with their own problems inside their own communities. That is the problem of the failure of the civil rights bill.And so in a larger sense we must then ask, How is it that black people move? And what do we do? But the question in a greater sense is, How can white people who are the majority -- and who are responsible for making democracy work -- make it work? They have miserably failed to this point. They have never made democracy work, be it inside the United States, Vietnam, South Africa, Philippines, South America, Puerto Rico. Wherever American has been, she has not been able to make democracy work; so that in a larger sense, we not only condemn the country for what it's done internally, but we must condemn it for what it does externally. We see this country trying to rule the world, and someone must stand up and start articulating that this country is not God, and cannot rule the world.Now, then, before we move on we ought to develop the white supremacy attitudes that were either conscious or subconscious thought and how they run rampant through the society today. For example, the missionaries were sent to Africa. They went with the attitude that blacks were automatically inferior. As a matter of fact, the first act the missionaries did, you know, when they got to Africa was to make us cover up our bodies, because they said it got them excited. We couldnåÕt go bare-breasted any more because they got excited.Now when the missionaries came to civilize us because we were uncivilized, educate us because we were uneducated, and give us some -- some literate studies because we were illiterate, they charged a price. The missionaries came with the Bible, and we had the land. When they left, they had the land, and we still have the Bible. And that has been the rationalization for Western civilization as it moves across the world and stealing and plundering and raping everybody in its path. Their one rationalization is that the rest of the world is uncivilized and they are in fact civilized. And they are un-civil-ized.And that runs on today, you see, because what we have today is we have what we call modern-day Peace Corps missionaries, and they come into our ghettos and they Head Start, Upward Lift, Bootstrap, and Upward Bound us into white society, 'cause they donåÕt want to face the real problem which is a man is poor for one reason and one reason only: 'cause he does not have money -- period. If you want to get rid of poverty, you give people money -- period.And you ought not to tell me about people who donåÕt work, and you canåÕt give people money without working, 'cause if that were true, youåÕd have to start stopping Rockefeller, Bobby Kennedy, Lyndon Baines Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson, the whole of Standard Oil, the Gulf Corp, all of them, including probably a large number of the Board of Trustees of this university. So the question, then, clearly, is not whether or not one can work; itåÕs Who has power? Who has power to make his or her acts legitimate? That is all. And that this country, that power is invested in the hands of white people, and they make their acts legitimate. It is now, therefore, for black people to make our acts legitimate.Now we are now engaged in a psychological struggle in this country, and that is whether or not black people will have the right to use the words they want to use without white people giving their sanction to it; and that we maintain, whether they like it or not, we gonna use the word Black Power -- and let them address themselves to that; but that we are not going to wait for white people to sanction Black Power. WeåÕre tired waiting; every time black people move in this country, theyåÕre forced to defend their position before they move. ItåÕs time that the people who are supposed to be defending their position do that. That's white people. They ought to start defending themselves as to why they have oppressed and exploited us.Now it is clear that when this country started to move in terms of slavery, the reason for a man being picked as a slave was one reason -- because of the color of his skin. If one was black one was automatically inferior, inhuman, and therefore fit for slavery; so that the question of whether or not we are individually suppressed is nonsensical, and itåÕs a downright lie. We are oppressed as a group because we are black, not because we are lazy, not because we're apathetic, not because weåÕre stupid, not because we smell, not because we eat watermelon and have good rhythm. We are oppressed because we are black.And in order to get out of that oppression one must wield the group power that one has, not the individual power which this country then sets the criteria under which a man may come into it. That is what is called in this country as integration: You do what I tell you to do and then weåÕll let you sit at the table with us. And that we are saying that we have to be opposed to that. We must now set up criteria and that if there's going to be any integration, it's going to be a two-way thing. If you believe in integration, you can come live in Watts. You can send your children to the ghetto schools. LetåÕs talk about that. If you believe in integration, then weåÕre going to start adopting us some white people to live in our neighborhood.So it is clear that the question is not one of integration or segregation. Integration is a man's ability to want to move in there by himself. If someone wants to live in a white neighborhood and he is black, that is his choice. It should be his rights. It is not because white people will not allow him. So vice versa: If a black man wants to live in the slums, that should be his right. Black people will let him. That is the difference. And it's a difference on which this country makes a number of logical mistakes when they begin to try to criticize the program articulated by SNCC.Now we maintain that we cannot be afford to be concerned about 6 percent of the children in this country, black children, who you allow to come into white schools. We have 94 percent who still live in shacks. We are going to be concerned about those 94 percent. You ought to be concerned about them too. The question is, Are we willing to be concerned about those 94 percent? Are we willing to be concerned about the black people who will never get to Berkeley, who will never get to Harvard, and cannot get an education, so youåÕll never get a chance to rub shoulders with them and say, Well, heåÕs almost as good as we are; heåÕs not like the others? The question is, How can white society begin to move to see black people as human beings? I am black, therefore I am; not that I am black and I must go to college to prove myself. I am black, therefore I am. And donåÕt deprive me of anything and say to me that you must go to college before you gain access to X, Y, and Z. It is only a rationalization for one's oppression.The -- The political parties in this country do not meet the needs of people on a day-to-day basis. The question is, How can we build new political institutions that will become the political expressions of people on a day-to-day basis? The question is, How can you build political institutions that will begin to meet the needs of Oakland, California? And the needs of Oakland, California, is not 1,000 policemen with submachine guns. They don't need that. They need that least of all. The question is, How can we build institutions where those people can begin to function on a day-to-day basis, where they can get decent jobs, where they can get decent houses, and where they can begin to participate in the policy and major decisions that affect their lives? ThatåÕs what they need, not Gestapo troops, because this is not 1942, and if you play like Nazis, we playing back with you this time around. Get hip to that.The question then is, How can white people move to start making the major institutions that they have in this country function the way it is supposed to function? That is the real question. And can white people move inside their own community and start tearing down racism where in fact it does exist? Where it exists. It is you who live in Cicero and stop us from living there. It is white people who stop us from moving into Grenada. It is white people who make sure that we live in the ghettos of this country. it is white institutions that do that. They must change. In order -- In order for America to really live on a basic principle of human relationships, a new society must be born. Racism must die, and the economic exploitation of this country of non-white peoples around the world must also die -- must also die.Now there are several programs that we have in the South, most in poor white communities. We're trying to organize poor whites on a base where they can begin to move around the question of economic exploitation and political disfranchisement. We know -- we've heard the theory several times -- but few people are willing to go into there. The question is, Can the white activist not try to be a Pepsi generation who comes alive in the black community, but can he be a man whoåÕs willing to move into the white community and start organizing where the organization is needed? Can he do that? The question is, Can the white society or the white activist disassociate himself with two clowns who waste time parrying with each other rather than talking about the problems that are facing people in this state? Can you dissociate yourself with those clowns and start to build new institutions that will eliminate all idiots like them.And the question is, If we are going to do that when and where do we start, and how do we start? We maintain that we must start doing that inside the white community. Our own personal position politically is that we don't think the Democratic Party represents the needs of black people. We know it don't. And that if, in fact, white people really believe that, the question is, if theyåÕre going to move inside that structure, how are they going to organize around a concept of whiteness based on true brotherhood and based on stopping exploitation, economic exploitation, so that there will be a coalition base for black people to hook up with? You cannot form a coalition based on national sentiment. That is not a coalition. If you need a coalition to redress itself to real changes in this country, white people must start building those institutions inside the white community. And that is the real question, I think, facing the white activists today. Can they, in fact, begin to move into and tear down the institutions which have put us all in a trick bag that weåÕve been into for the last hundred years?I don't think that we should follow what many people say that we should fight to be leaders of tomorrow. Frederick Douglass said that the youth should fight to be leaders today. And God knows we need to be leaders today, 'cause the men who run this country are sick, are sick. So that can we on a larger sense begin now, today, to start building those institutions and to fight to articulate our position, to fight to be able to control our universities -- We need to be able to do that -- and to fight to control the basic institutions which perpetuate racism by destroying them and building new ones? ThatåÕs the real question that face us today, and it is a dilemma because most of us do not know how to work, and that the excuse that most white activists find is to run into the black community.Now we maintain that we cannot have white people working in the black community, and we mean it on a psychological ground. The fact is that all black people often question whether or not they are equal to whites, because every time they start to do something, white people are around showing them how to do it. If we are going to eliminate that for the generation that comes after us, then black people must be seen in positions of power, doing and articulating for themselves, for themselves.That is not to say that one is a reverse racist; it is to say that one is moving in a healthy ground; it is to say what the philosopher Sartre says: One is becoming an antiracist racist. And this country canåÕt understand that. Maybe it's because it's all caught up in racism. But I think what you have in SNCC is an anti-racist racism. We are against racists. Now if everybody who is white see themself [sic] as a racist and then see us against him, they're speaking from their own guilt position, not ours, not ours.Now then, the question is, How can we move to begin to change what's going on in this country. I maintain, as we have in SNCC, that the war in Vietnam is an illegal and immoral war. And the question is, What can we do to stop that war? What can we do to stop the people who, in the name of our country, are killing babies, women, and children? What can we do to stop that? And I maintain that we do not have the power in our hands to change that institution, to begin to recreate it, so that they learn to leave the Vietnamese people alone, and that the only power we have is the power to say, Hell no! to the draft.We have to say -- We have to say to ourselves that there is a higher law than the law of a racist named McNamara. There is a higher law than the law of a fool named Rusk. And there's a higher law than the law of a buffoon named Johnson. ItåÕs the law of each of us. It's the law of each of us. It is the law of each of us saying that we will not allow them to make us hired killers. We will stand pat. We will not kill anybody that they say kill. And if we decide to kill, we're going to decide who we going to kill. And this country will only be able to stop the war in Vietnam when the young men who are made to fight it begin to say, Hell, no, we ainåÕt going.Now then, there's a failure because the Peace Movement has been unable to get off the college campuses where everybody has a 2S and not going to get drafted anyway. And the question is, How can you move out of that into the white ghettos of this country and begin to articulate a position for those white students who do not want to go. We cannot do that. It is something -- sometimes ironic that many of the peace groups have beginning to call us violent and say they can no longer support us, and we are in fact the most militant organization [for] peace or civil rights or human rights against the war in Vietnam in this country today. There isnåÕt one organization that has begun to meet our stance on the war in Vietnam, 'cause we not only say we are against the war in Vietnam; we are against the draft. We are against the draft. No man has the right to take a man for two years and train him to be a killer. A man should decide what he wants to do with his life.So the question then is it becomes crystal clear for black people because we can easily say that anyone fighting in the war in Vietnam is nothing but a black mercenary, and that's all he is. Any time a black man leaves the country where he canåÕt vote to supposedly deliver the vote for somebody else, heåÕs a black mercenary. Any time a -- Any time a black man leaves this country, gets shot in Vietnam on foreign ground, and returns home and you wonåÕt give him a burial in his own homeland, heåÕs a black mercenary, a black mercenary.And that even if I were tobelieve the lies of Johnson, if I were to believe his lies that we're fighting to give democracy to the people in Vietnam, as a black man living in this country I wouldnåÕt fight to give this to anybody. I wouldn't give it to anybody. So that we have to use our bodies and our minds in the only way that we see fit. We must begin like the philosopher Camus to come alive by saying No! That is the only act in which we begin to come alive, and we have to say No! to many, many things in this country.This country is a nation of thieves. It has stole everything it has, beginning with black people, beginning with black people. And that the question is, How can we move to start changing this country from what it is -- a nation of thieves. This country cannot justify any longer its existence. We have become the policeman of the world. The marines are at our disposal to always bring democracy, and if the Vietnamese donåÕt want democracy, well dammit, WeåÕll just wipe them the hell out, 'cause they donåÕt deserve to live if they wonåÕt have our way of life.There is then in a larger sense, What do you do on your university campus? Do you raise questions about the hundred black students who were kicked off campus a couple of weeks ago? Eight hundred? Eight hundred? And how does that question begin to move? Do you begin to relate to people outside of the ivory tower and university wall? Do you think youåÕre capable of building those human relationships, as the country now stands? You're fooling yourself. It is impossible for white and black people to talk about building a relationship based on humanity when the country is the way it is, when the institutions are clearly against us.We have taken all the myths of this country and we've found them to be nothing but downright lies. This country told us that if we worked hard we would succeed, and if that were true we would own this country lock, stock, and barrel -- lock, stock, and barrel -- lock, stock, and barrel. It is we who have picked the cotton for nothing. It is we who are the maids in the kitchens of liberal white people. It is we who are the janitors, the porters, the elevator men; we who sweep up your college floors. Yes, it is we who are the hardest workers and the lowest paid, and the lowest paid. And that it is nonsensical for people to start talking about human relationships until they're willing to build new institutions. Black people are economically insecure. White liberals are economically secure. Can you begin to build an economic coalition? Are the liberals willing to share their salaries with the economically insecure black people they so much love? Then if youåÕre not, are you willing to start building new institutions that will provide economic security for black people? ThatåÕs the question we want to deal with. That's the question we want to deal with.We have to seriously examine the histories that we have been told. But we have something more to do than that. American students are perhaps the most politically unsophisticated students in the world, in the world, in the world. Across every country in this world, while we were growing up, students were leading the major revolutions of their countries. We have not been able to do that. They have been politically aware of their existence. In South America our neighbors down below the border have one every 24 hours just to remind us that they're politically aware.And we have been unable to grasp it because weåÕve always moved in the field of morality and love while people have been politically jiving with our lives. And the question is, How do we now move politically and stop trying to move morally? You can't move morally against a man like Brown and Reagan. You've got to move politically to put them out of business. You've got to move politically.You canåÕt move morally against Lyndon Baines Johnson because he is an immoral man. He doesnåÕt know what itåÕs all about. So youåÕve got to move politically. You've got to move politically. And that we have to begin to develop a political sophistication -- which is not to be a parrot: The two-party system is the best party in the world. There is a difference between being a parrot and being politically sophisticated. We have to raise questions about whether or not we do need new types of political institutions in this country, and we in SNCC maintain that we need them now. We need new political institutions in this country. Any time -- Any time Lyndon Baines Johnson can head a Party which has in it Bobby Kennedy, Wayne Morse, Eastland, Wallace, and all those other supposed-to-be-liberal cats, thereåÕs something wrong with that Party. TheyåÕre moving politically, not morally. And that if that party refuses to seat black people from Mississippi and goes ahead and seats racists like Eastland and his clique, it is clear to me that theyåÕre moving politically, and that one cannot begin to talk morality to people like that.We must begin to think politically and see if we can have the power to impose and keep the moral values that we hold high. We must question the values of this society, and I maintain that black people are the best people to do that because we have been excluded from that society. And the question is, we ought to think whether or not we want to become a part of that society. That's what we want to do.And that that is precisely what it seems to me that the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee is doing. We are raising questions about this country. I do not want to be a part of the American pie. The American pie means raping South Africa, beating Vietnam, beating South America, raping the Philippines, raping every country youåÕve been in. I donåÕt want any of your blood money. I donåÕt want it -- don't want to be part of that system. And the question is, How do we raise those questions? How do we ....How do we begin to raise them?We have grown up and we are the generation that has found this country to be a world power, that has found this country to be the wealthiest country in the world. We must question how she got her wealth? That's what we're questioning, and whether or not we want this country to continue being the wealthiest country in the world at the price of raping every -- everybody else across the world. That's what we must begin to question. And that because black people are saying we do not now want to become a part of you, we are called reverse racists. AinåÕt that a gas?Now, then, we want to touch on nonviolence because we see that again as the failure of white society to make nonviolence work. I was always surprised at Quakers who came to Alabama and counseled me to be nonviolent, but didnåÕt have the guts to start talking to James Clark to be nonviolent. That is where nonviolence needs to be preached -- to Jim Clark, not to black people. They have already been nonviolent too many years. The question is, Can white people conduct their nonviolent schools in Cicero where they belong to be conducted, not among black people in Mississippi. Can they conduct it among the white people in Grenada?Six-foot-two men who kick little black children -- can you conduct nonviolent schools there? That is the question that we must raise, not that you conduct nonviolence among black people. Can you name me one black man today who's killed anybody white and is still alive? Even after rebellion, when some black brothers throw some bricks and bottles, ten thousand of them has to pay the crime, 'cause when the white policeman comes in, anybody whoåÕs black is arrested, 'cause we all look alike.So that we have to raise those questions. We, the youth of this country, must begin to raise those questions. And we must begin to move to build new institutions that's going to speak to the needs of people who need it. We are going to have to speak to change the foreign policy of this country. One of the problems with the peace movement is that it's just too caught up in Vietnam, and that if we pulled out the troops from Vietnam this week, next week youåÕd have to get another peace movement for Santo Domingo. And the question is, How do you begin to articulate the need to change the foreign policy of this country -- a policy that is decided upon race, a policy on which decisions are made upon getting economic wealth at any price, at any price.Now we articulate that we therefore have to hook up with black people around the world; and that that hookup is not only psychological, but becomes very real. If South America today were to rebel, and black people were to shoot the hell out of all the white people there -- as they should, as they should -- then Standard Oil would crumble tomorrow. If South Africa were to go today, Chase Manhattan Bank would crumble tomorrow. If Zimbabwe, which is called Rhodesia by white people, were to go tomorrow, General Electric would cave in on the East Coast. The question is, How do we stop those institutions that are so willing to fight against Communist aggression but closes their eyes to racist oppression? That is the question that you raise. Can this country do that?Now, many people talk about pulling out of Vietnam. What will happen? If we pull out of Vietnam, there will be one less aggressor in there -- we won't be there, we won't be there. And so the question is, How do we articulate those positions? And we cannot begin to articulate them from the same assumptions that the people in the country speak, 'cause they speak from different assumptions than I assume what the youth in this country are talking about.That we're not talking about a policy or aid or sending Peace Corps people in to teach people how to read and write and build houses while we steal their raw materials from them. Is that what we're talking about? 'Cause thatåÕs all we do. What underdeveloped countries needs -- information on how to become industrialized, so they can keep their raw materials where they have it, produce them and sell it to this country for the price itåÕs supposed to pay; not that we produce it and sell it back to them for a profit and keep sending our modern day missionaries in, calling them the sons of Kennedy. And that if the youth are going to participate in that program, how do you raise those questions where you begin to control that Peace Corps program? How do you begin to raise them? How do we raise the questions of poverty? The assumptions of this country is that if someone is poor, they are poor because of their own individual blight, or they werenåÕt born on the right side of town; they had too many children; they went in the army too early; or their father was a drunk, or they didnåÕt care about school, or they made a mistake. ThatåÕs a lot of nonsense. Poverty is well calculated in this country. It is well calculated, and the reason why the poverty program wonåÕt work is because the calculators of poverty are administering it. Th",,,61," Hubert Humphrey - 1948 Democratic Convention Speech (transcript-audio-video)Hubert H. Humphrey1948 Democratic National Convention Address delivered 14 July 1948, Philadelphia, PA  );  "", ""//www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/01098/audio/01098_00102."");   ;   for flash]Mr. Chairman, fellow Democrats, fellow Americans: I realize that in speaking in behalf of the minority report on civilrights as presented by Congressman DeMiller of Wisconsin that I'm dealing with a chargedissue -- with an issue which has been confused by emotionalism on all sides of the fence. Irealize that there are here today friends and colleagues of mine, many of them, who feeljust as deeply and keenly as I do about this issue and who are yet in completedisagreement with me.My respect and admiration for these men and their views was greatwhen I came to this convention. It is now far greater because of the sincerity, thecourtesy, and the forthrightness with which many of them have argued in our prolongeddiscussions in the platform committee.Because of this very great respect -- and because of my profoundbelief that we have a challenging task to do here -- because good conscience, decentmorality, demands it -- I feel I must rise at this time to support a report -- the minorityreport -- a report that spells out our democracy, a report that the people of this countrycan and will understand, and a report that they will enthusiastically acclaim on the greatissue of civil rights.Now let me say this at the outset that this proposal is made for nosingle region. Our proposal is made for no single class, for no single racial or religiousgroup in mind. All of the regions of this country, all of the states have shared inour precious heritage of American freedom. All the states and all the regions have seen atleast some of the infringements of that freedom -- all people -- get this -- all people, white andblack, all groups, all racial groups have been the victims at time[s] in this nation of -- letme say -- vicious discrimination.The masterly statement of our keynote speaker, the distinguishedUnited States Senator from Kentucky, Alben Barkley, made that point with great force.Speaking of the founder of our Party, Thomas Jefferson, he said this, and I quote fromAlben Barkley: He did not proclaim that all the white, or theblack, or the red, or the yellow men are equal; that all Christian or Jewish men areequal; that all Protestant and Catholic men are equal; that all rich and poor men areequal; that all good and bad men are equal. What he declared was that all men are equal; and the equalitywhich he proclaimed was the equality in the right to enjoy the blessings of freegovernment in which they may participate and to which they have given their support.Now these words of Senator Barkley&#146;s are appropriate to thisconvention -- appropriate to this convention of the oldest, the most truly progressivepolitical party in America. From the time of Thomas Jefferson, the time when that immortalAmerican doctrine of individual rights, under just and fairly administered laws, theDemocratic Party has tried hard to secure expanding freedoms for all citizens. Oh, yes, Iknow, other political parties may have talked more about civil rights, but the Democraticparty has surely done more about civil rights.We have made progress -- we've made great progress in every part ofthis country. We&#146;ve made great progress in the South; we&#146;ve made it in the West,in the North, and in the East. But we must now focus the direction of that progress towardsthe -- towards the realization of a full program of civil rights to all. This convention must set outmore specifically the direction in which our Party efforts are to go.We can be proud that we can be guided by the courageous trailblazing of two great Democratic Presidents. We can be proud of the fact that our great andbeloved immortal leader Franklin Roosevelt gave us guidance. And we be proud of thefact -- we can be proud of the fact that Harry Truman has had the courage to give to thepeople of America the new emancipation proclamation.It seems to me -- It seems to me that the Democratic Party needs toto make definite pledges of the kinds suggested in the minority report, to maintain the trust and the confidence placed in it by the people of all races and all sections of this country. Sure, weåÕre here as Democrats. But my good friends, weåÕre here as Americans; weåÕre here as the believers in the principle and the ideology of democracy, and I firmly believe that as men concerned with our countryåÕs future, we must specify in our platform the guarantees which we have mentioned in the minority report.Yes, this is far more than a Party matter. Every citizen in this country has a stake in the emergence of the United States as a leader in the free world. That world is being challenged by the world of slavery. For us to play our part effectively, we must be in a morally sound position. We canåÕt use a double standard -- ThereåÕs no room for double standards in American politics -- for measuring our own and other peopleåÕs policies. Our demands for democratic practices in other lands will be no more effective than the guarantee of those practices in our own country.Friends, delegates, I do not believe that there can be any compromise on the guarantees of the civil rights which we have mentioned in the minority report. In spite of my desire for unanimous agreement on the entire platform, in spite of my desire to see everybody here in honest and unanimous agreement, there are some matters which I think must be stated clearly and without qualification. There can be no hedging -- the newspaper headlines are wrong. There will be no hedging, and there will be no watering down -- if you please -- of the instruments and the principles of the civil-rights program.My friends, to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights, I say to them we are 172 years late. To those who say that this civil-rights program is an infringement on statesåÕ rights, I say this: The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states' rights and to walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights. People -- human beings -- this is the issue of the 20th century. People of all kinds -- all sorts of people -- and these people are looking to America for leadership, and theyåÕre looking to America for precept and example.My good friends, my fellow Democrats, I ask you for a calm consideration of our historic opportunity. Let us do forget the evil passions and the blindness of the past. In these times of world economic, political, and spiritual -- above all spiritual crisis, we cannot and we must not turn from the path so plainly before us. That path has already lead us through many valleys of the shadow of death. And now is the time to recall those who were left on that path of American freedom.For all of us here, for the millions who have sent us, for the whole two billion members of the human family, our land is now, more than ever before, the last best hope on earth. And I know that we can, and I know that we shall began [sic] here the fuller and richer realization of that hope, that promise of a land where all men are truly free and equal, and each man uses his freedom and equality wisely well.My good friends, I ask my Party, I ask the Democratic Party, to march down the high road of progressive democracy. I ask this convention to say in unmistakable terms that we proudly hail, and we courageously support, our President and leader Harry Truman in his great fight for civil rights in America!Book/CDs by Michael E.

Eidenmuller.",,,62," Emma Goldman -- Address to the Jury  Emma GoldmanAddress to the Jury delivered 9 July 1917, New York for flashGentlemen of the Jury:As in the case of my co-defendant, Alexander Berkman, this is also the first time in my life I have ever addressed a jury. I once had occasion to speak to three judges.On the day after our arrest it was give out by the U. S. Marshal and the District AttorneyåÕs office that the åÒbig fishåÓ of the No-Conscription activities had been caught, and that there would be no more trouble-makers and disturbers to interfere with the highly democratic effort of the Government to conscript its young manhood for the European slaughter. What a pity that the faithful servants of the Government, personified in the U. S. Marsha land the District Attorney, should have used such a weak and flimsy net for their big catch. The moment the anglers pulled their heavily laden net ashore, it broke, and all the labor was so much wasted energy.The methods employed by Marshal McCarthy and his hosts of heroic warriors were sensational enough to satisfy the famous circus men, Barnum &amp; Baily. A dozen or more heroes dashing up two flights of stairs, prepared to stake their lives for their country, only to discover the two dangerous disturbers and trouble-makers Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman, in their separate offices, quietly at work at their desks, wielding not a sword, nor a gun or a bomb, but merely their pens! Verily, it required courage to catch such big fish.To be sure, tow officers equipped with a warrant would have sufficed to carry out the business of arresting the defendants Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman. Even the police know that neither of them is in the habit of running away or hiding under the bed. But the farce-comedy had to be properly staged if the Marshal and the District Attorney were to earn immortality. Hence the sensational arrest; hence, also, the raid upon the offices of THE BLAST, MOTHER EARTH and the No-Conscription League.In their zeal to save the country from the trouble-makers, the Marshal and his helpers did not even consider it necessary to produce a search warrant. After all, what matters a mere scrap of paper when one is called upon to raid the offices of Anarchists! Of what consequence is the sanctity of property, the right of privacy, to officials in their dealings with Anarchists! In our day of military training for battle, and Anarchist office is an appropriate camping ground. Would the gentlemen who came with Marshal McCarthy have dared to go into the offices of Morgan, of Rockefeller, or of any of those men without a search warrant? They never showed us the search warrant, although we asked them for it. Nevertheless, they turned our office into a battlefield, so that when they were through with it, it looked like invaded Belgium, with the only difference that the invaders were not Prussian barbarians but good American patriots bent on making New York safe for democracy.The stage having been appropriately set for the three-act comedy, and the first act successfully played by carrying off the villains in a madly dashing automobile -- which broke every traffic regulation and barely escaped crushing every one in its way--the second act proved even more ludicrous. Fifty thousand dollars bail was demanded, and real estate refused when offered by a man whose property is rated at three hundred thousand dollars, and that after the District Attorney had considered and, in fact, promised to accept the property for one of the defendants, Alexander Berkman, thus breaking every right guaranteed even to the most heinous criminal.Finally the third act, played by the Government in this court during the last week. The pity of it is that the prosecution knows so little of dramatic construction, else it would have equipped itself with better dramatic material to sustain the continuity of the play. As it was, the third act fell flat, utterly, and presents the question, Why such a tempest in a teapot?Gentlemen of the jury, my comrade and co-defendant having carefully and thoroughly gone into the evidence presented by the prosecution, and having demonstrated its entire failure to prove the charge of conspiracy or any overt acts to carry out that conspiracy, I shall not impose upon your patience by going over the same ground, except to emphasize a few points. To charge people with having conspired to do something which they have been engaged in doing most of their lives, namely their campaign against war, militarism and conscription as contrary to the best interests of humanity, is an insult to human intelligence.And how was that charge proven? By the fact that MOTHER EARTH and THE BLAST were printed by the same printer and bound in the same bindery. By the further evidence that the same expressman had  delivered to two publications! An by the still more illuminating fact that on June 2nd MOTHER EARTH and THE BLAST were given to a reporter at his request, if your please, and gratis.Gentlemen of the jury, you saw the reporter who testified to this overt act. Did any one of you receive the impression that the man was of conscriptable age, and if not in what possible way is the giving of MOTHER EARTH to a report for news purposes proof demonstrating the overt act?It was brought out by our witnesses that the MOTHER EARTH magazine has been published for twelve years; that it was never held up, and that it has always gone through the U. S. mail as second-class mail matter. It was further proven that the magazine appeared each month about the first or second, and that it was sold or given away at the office to whoever wanted a copy. Where, then, is the overt act?Just as the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the charge of conspiracy, so has it also failed to prove the overt act by the flimsy testimony that MOTHER EARTH was given to a reporter. The same holds good regarding THE BLAST.Gentlemen of the jury, the District Attorney must have learned from the reporters the gist of the numerous interviews which they had with us. Why did he not examine them as to whether or not we had counseled young men not to register? That would have been a more direct way of getting at the facts. In the case of the reporter from the New York Times, there can be no doubt that the man would have been only too happy to accommodate the District Attorney with the required information. A man who disregards every principle of decency and ethics of his profession as a newspaper man, by turning material given him as news over to the District Attorney, would have been glad to oblige a friend. Why did Mr. Content neglect such a golden opportunity? Was it no because the reporter of the Times, like all the other reporters, must have told the District Attorney that the two defendants stated, on each and every occasion, they would not tell people not to register?Perhaps the Times reporter refused to go to the extent of perjuring himself. Patrolmen and detectives are not so timid in such matters. Hence Mr. Randolph and Mr. Cadell, to rescue the situation. Imagine employing tenth-rate stenographers to report the very important speeches of dangerous trouble-makers! What lack of forethought and efficiency on the part of the District Attorney! But even these two members of the police department failed to prove by their notes that we advised people not to register. But since they had to produce something incriminating against Anarchists, they conveniently resorted to the old standby, always credited to us, åÒWe believe in violence and we will use violence.åÓAssuming, gentlemen of the jury, that his sentence was really used at the meeting of May 18th, it would still fail to prove the indictment which charges conspiracy and overt acts to carry out the conspiracy. And that is all we are charged with. Not violence, not Anarchism. I will go further and say, that had the indictment been for the advocacy of violence, you gentlemen of the jury, would still have to render a verdict of åÒNot Guilty,åÓ since the mere belief in a thing or even the announcement that you would carry out that belief, can not possibly constitute a crime.However, I wish to say emphatically that no such expression as åÒWe believe in violence and we will use violenceåÓ was uttered at the meeting of May 18th, or at any other meeting. I could not have employed such a phrase, as there was no occasion for it. If for no other reason, it is because I want my lectures and speeches to be coherent and logical. The sentence credited to me is neither.I have read to you my position toward political violence from a lengthy essay called åÒThe Psychology of Political Violence.åÓBut to make that a position clearer and simpler, I wish to say that I am a social student. It is my mission in life to ascertain the cause of our social evils and of our social difficulties. As a student of social wrongs it is my aim to diagnose a wrong. To simply condemn the man who has committed an act of political violence, in order to save my skin, would be as unpardonable as it would be on the part of the physician, who is called to diagnose a case, to condemn the patient because the patient has tuberculosis, caner, or some other disease. The honest, earnest, sincere physician does not only prescribe medicine, he tries to find out the cause of the disease. And if the patient is at all capable as to means, the doctor will say to him, åÒGet out of this putrid air, get out of the factory, get out of the place where your lungs are being infected.åÓ He will not merely give him medicine. He will tell him the cause of the disease. And that is precisely my position in regard to acts of violence. That is what I have said on every platform. I have attempted to explain the cause and the reason for acts of political violence.It is organized violence on top which creates individual violence at the bottom. It is the accumulated indignation against organized wrong, organized crime, organized injustice which drives the political offender to his act. To condemn him means to be blind to the causes which make him. I can no more do it, nor have I the right to, than the physician who were to condemn the patient for his disease. You and I and all of us who remain indifferent to the crimes of poverty, of war, of human degradation, are equally responsible for the act committed by the political offender. May I therefore be permitted to say, in the words of a great teacher: åÒHe who is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone.åÓ Does that mean advocating violence? You might as well accuse Jesus of advocating prostitution, because He took the part of the prostitute, Mary Magdalene.Gentlemen of the jury, the meeting of the 18th of May was called primarily for the purpose of voicing the position of the conscientious objector and to point out the evils of conscription. Now, who and what is the conscientious objector? Is he really a shirker, a slacker, or a coward? To call him that is to be guilty of dense ignorance of the forces which impel men and women to stand out against the whole world like a glittering lone star upon a dark horizon. The conscientious objector is impelled by what President Wilson in his speech of Feb. 3, 1917, called åÒthe righteous passion for justice upon which all war, all structure of family, State and of mankind must rest as the ultimate base of our existence or our liberty.åÓ The righteous passion for justice which can never express itself in human slaughter -- that is the force which makes the conscientious objector. Poor indeed is the country which fails to recognize the importance of that new type of humanity as the åÒultimate base of our existence and liberty.åÓ It will find itself barren of that which makes for character and quality in its people.The meeting of May 18th was held before the Draft Bill had actually gone into effect. The President signed it late in the evening of the 18th. Whatever was said at the meeting, even if I had counseled young men not to register, that meeting cannot serve as proof of an overt act. Why, then, has the Prosecuting Attorney dwelt so much, at such length, and with such pains on that meeting, and so little on the other meetings held on the eve of registration and after? Is it not because the District Attorney knew that we had no stenographic notes of that meeting? He knew it because he was approached by Mr. Weinberger and other friends for a copy of the transcript, which request he refused. Evidently, the District Attorney felt safe to use the notes of a patrolman and a detective, knowing that they would swear to anything their superiors wanted. I never like to accuse anyone -- I wouldnåÕt go so far as my co-defendant, Mr. Berkman, in saying that the District Attorney doctored the document; I donåÕt know whether he did or not. But I do know that Patrolman Randolph and Detective Cadell doctored the notes, for the simple reason that I didnåÕt say those things. But though we could not produce our own stenographic notes, we have been able to prove by men and women of unimpeachable character and high intelligence that the notes of Randolph are utterly false. We have also proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and Mr. Content did not dare question our proof, that at the HuntsåÕ Point Palace, held on the eve or registration, I expressly stated that I cannot and will not tell people not to register. We have further proven that this was my definite stand, which was explained in my statement sent from Springfield and read at the meeting of May 23rd.When we go through the entire testimony given on behalf of the prosecution, I insist that there is not one single point to sustain the indictment for conspiracy or to prove the overt acts we are supposed to have committed. But we were even compelled to bring a man eighty years of age to the witness stand in order to stop, if possible, and intention to drag in the question of German money. It is true, and I appreciate it, that Mr. Content said he had no knowledge of it. But, gentlemen of the jury, somebody from the District AttorneyåÕs office or someone from the MarshalåÕs office must have given out the statement that a bank receipt for $2,400 was found in my office and must have told the newspapers the fake story of German money. As if we would ever touch German money, or Russian money, or American money coming from the ruling class, to advance our ideas ! But in order to forestall any suspicion, any insinuation, in order to stand clear before you, we were compelled to bring an old man here to inform you that he has been a radical all his life, that he is interested in our ideas, and that he is the man who contributed the money for radical purposes and for the work of Miss Goldman.Gentlemen of the jury, you will be told by the Court, I am sure, that when you render a verdict you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt; that you must not assume that we are guilty before we are proven guilty; and that it is your duty to assume that we are innocent. And yet, as a matter of fact, the burden of proof has been laid upon us. We had to bring witnesses. If we had had time we could have brought fifty more witnesses, each corroborating the others. Some of those people have no relation with us. Some are writers, poets, contributors to the most conventional magazines. Is it likely that they would swear to something in our favor if it were not the truth? Therefore I insist, as did my co-defendant Alexander Berkman, that the prosecution has made a very poor showing in proving the conspiracy or any overt act.Gentlemen of the jury, we have been in public life for twenty-seven years. We have been haled into court, in and out of season -- we have never denied our position. Even the police know that Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman are not shirkers. You have had occasion during this trial to convince yourselves that we do not deny. We have gladly and proudly claimed responsibility, not only for what we ourselves have said and written, but even for things written by others and with which we did not agree. Is it plausible, then, that we would go through the ordeal, trouble and expense of a lengthy trial to escape responsibility in this instance? A thousand times no! But we refuse to be tried on a trumped-up charge, or to be convicted by perjured testimony, merely because we are Anarchists and hated by the class whom we have openly fought for many years.Gentlemen, during our examination of talesmen, when we asked whether you would be prejudiced against us if it were proven that we propagated ideas and opinions contrary to those held by the majority, you were instructed by the Court to say, åÒIf they are within the law.åÓ But what the Court did not tell you is, that no new faith -- not even the most humane and peaceable -- has ever been considered åÒwithin the lawåÓ by those who were in power. The history of human growth is at the same time the history of every new idea heralding the approach of a brighter dawn, and the brighter dawn has always been considered illegal, outside of the law.Gentlemen of the jury, most of you, I take it, are believers in the teachings of Jesus. Bear in mind that he was put to death by those who considered his views as being against the law. I also take it that you are proud of you Americanism. Remember that those who fought and bled for your liberties were in their time considered as being against the law, as dangerous disturbers and trouble-makers. They not only preached violence, but they carried out their ideas by throwing tea into the Boston harbor. They said that åÒResistance to tyranny is obedience to God.åÓ They wrote a dangerous document called the Declaration of Independence. A document which continues to be dangerous to this day, and for the circulation of which a young man was sentenced to ninety days prison in a New Your Court, only the other day. They were the Anarchists of their time -- they were never within the law.Your Government is allied with the French Republic. Need I call you attention to the historic fact that the great upheaval in France was brought about by extra-legal means? The Dantes, the Robespieres, the Marats, the Herberts, aye even the man who is responsible for the most stirring revolutionary music, the Marseillaise (which unfortunately has deteriorated into a war tune) even Camille Desmoulins, were never within the law. But for those great pioneers and rebels, France would have continued under the yoke of the idle Louis XVI., to whom the sport of shooting jack rabbits was more important than the destiny of the people of France.Ah, gentlemen, on the very day when we were being tried for conspiracy and overt acts, your city officials and representatives welcomed with music and festivities the Russian Commission. Are you aware of the fact that nearly all of the members of that Commission have only recently been released from exile? The ideas they propagated were never within the law. For nearly a hundred years, from 1825 to 1917, the Tree of Liberty in Russia was watered by the blood of her martyrs. No greater heroism, no nobler lives had ever been dedicated to humanity. Not one of them worked within the law. I could continue to enumerate almost endlessly the hosts of men and women in every land and in every period whose ideas and ideals redeemed the world because they were not within the law.Never can a new idea move within the law. It matters not whether that idea pertains to political and social changes or to any other domain of human thought and expression -- to science, literature, music; in fact, everything that makes for freedom and joy and beauty must refuse to move within the law. How can it be otherwise? The law is stationary, fixed, mechanical, åÒa chariot wheelåÓ which grinds all alike without regard to time, place and condition, without ever taking into account cause and effect, without ever going into the complexity of the human soul.Progress knows nothing of fixity. It cannot be pressed into a definite mould. It cannot bow to the dictum, åÒI have ruled,åÓ åÒI am the regulating finger of God.åÓ Progress is ever renewing, ever becoming, ever changing -- never is it within the law.If that be crime, we are criminals even like Jesus, Socrates, Galileo, Bruno, John Brown and scores of others. We are in good company, among those whom Havelock Ellis, the greatest living psychologist, describes as the political criminals recognized by the whole civilized world, except America, as men and women who out of deep love for humanity, out of a passionate reverence for liberty and an all-absorbing devotion to an ideal are ready to pay for their faith even with their blood. We cannot do otherwise if we are to be true to ourselves -- we know that the political criminal is the precursor of human progress -- the political criminal of today must needs be the hero, the martyr and the saint of the new age.But, says the Prosecuting Attorney, the press and the unthinking rabble, in high and low station, åÒthat is a dangerous doctrine and unpatriotic at this time.åÓ No doubt it is. But are we to be held responsible for something which is as unchangeable and unalienable as the very stars hanging in the heavens unto time and all eternity?Gentlemen to the jury, we respect your patriotism. We would not, if we could, have you change its meaning for yourself. But may there not be different kinds of patriotism as there are different kinds of liberty? I for one cannot believe that love of oneåÕs country must needs consist in blindness to its social faults, to deafness to its social discords, of inarticulation to its social wrongs. Neither can I believe that the mere accident of birth in a certain country or the mere scrap of a citizenåÕs paper constitutes the love of country.I know many people -- I am one of them -- who were not born here, nor have the applied for citizenship, and who yet love America with deeper passion and greater intensity that many natives whose patriotism manifests itself by pulling, kicking, and insulting those who do not rise when the national anthem is played. Our patriotism is that of the man who loves a woman with open eyes. He is enchanted by her beauty, yet he sees her faults. So we, too, who know America, love her beauty, her richness, her great possibilities; we love her mountains, her canyons, her forests, her Niagara, and her deserts -- above all do we love the people that have produced her wealth, her artists who have created beauty, her great apostles who dream and work for liberty -- but with the same passionate emotion we hate her superficiality, her cant, her corruption, her mad, unscrupulous worship at the alter of the Golden Calf.We say that if America has entered the war to make the world safe for democracy, she must first make democracy safe in America. How else is the world to take America seriously, when democracy at home is daily being outrages, free speech suppressed, peaceable assemblies broken up by overbearing and brutal gangsters in uniform; when free press is curtailed and every independent opinion gagged. Verily, poor as we are in democracy, how can we give of it to the world? We further say that a democracy conceived in the military servitude of the masses, in their economic enslavement, and nurtured in their tears and blood, is not democracy at all. It is despotism -- the cumulative result of a chain of abuses which, according to the dangerous document ,the Declaration of Independence, the people have the right to overthrow.The District Attorney has dragged in our Manifesto, and he has emphasized the passage, åÒResist conscription.åÓ Gentlemen of the jury, please remember that that is not the charge against us. But admitting that the Manifesto contains the expression, åÒResist conscription,åÓ may I ask you, is there only one kind of resistance? Is there only the resistance which means the gun, the bayonet, the bomb or flying machine? Is there not another kind of resistance? May not the people simply fold their hands and declare, åÒWe will not fight when we do not believe in the necessity of waråÓ? May not the people who believe in the repeal of the Conscription Law, because it is unconstitutional, express their opposition in word and by pen, in meetings and in other ways? What right has the District Attorney to interpret that particular passage to suit himself? Moreover, gentlemen of the jury, I insist that the indictment against us does not refer to conscription. We are charged with a conspiracy against registration. And in no way or manner has the prosecution proven that we are guilty of conspiracy or that we have committed an overt act.Gentlemen of the jury, you are not called upon to accept our views, to approve of them or to justify them. You are not even called upon to decide whether our views are within or against the law. You are called upon to decide whether the prosecution has proven that the defendants Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman have conspired to urge people not to register. And whether their speeches and writings represent overt acts.Whatever you verdict, gentlemen, it cannot possibly affect the rising tide of discontent in this country against war which, despite all boasts, is a war for conquest and military power. Neither can it affect the ever increasing opposition to conscription which is a military and industrial yoke placed upon the necks of the American people. Least of all will your verdict affect those to whom human life is sacred, and who will not become a party to the world slaughter. Your verdict can only add to the opinion of the world as to whether or not justice and liberty are a living force in this country or a mere shadow of the past.Your verdict may, of course, affect us temporarily, in a physical sense -- it can have no effect whatever upon our spirit. For even if we were convicted and found guilty and the penalty were that we be placed against a wall and shot dead, I should nevertheless cry out with the great Luther: åÒHere I am and her I stand and I cannot do otherwise.åÓAnd gentlemen, in conclusion let me tell you that my co-defendant, Mr. Berkman, was right when he said the eyes of America are upon you. They are upon you not because of sympathy for us or agreement with Anarchism. They are upon you because it must decided sooner or later whether we are justified in telling people that we will give the democracy in Europe, when we have no democracy here? Shall free speech and free assemblage, shall criticism and opinion -- which even the espionage bill did not include -- be destroyed? Shall it be a shadow of the past, the great historic American past? Shall it be trampled underfoot by any detective, or policeman, anyone who decides upon it? Or shall free speech and free press and free assemblage continue to be the heritage of the American people?Gentlemen of the jury, whatever you verdict will be, as far as we are concerned, nothing will be changed. I have held ideas all my life. I have publicly held my ideas for twenty-seven years. Nothing on earth would ever make me change my ideas except one thing; and that is, if you will prove to me that our position is wrong, untenable, or lacking in historic fact. But never would I change my ideas because I am found guilty. I may remind you of two great Americans, undoubtedly not unknown to you, gentlemen of the jury; Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. When Thoreau was placed in prison for refusing to pay taxes, he was visited by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Emerson said: åÒDavid, what are you doing in jail?åÓ and Thoreau replied: åÒ Ralph, what are you doing outside, when honest people are in jail for their ideals?åÓ Gentlemen of the jury, I do not wish to influence you. I do not wish to appeal to you passions. I do not wish to influence you by the fact that I am a woman. I have no such desires and no such designs. I take it that you are sincere enough and honest enough and brave enough to render a verdict according to you convictions, beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt.Please forget that we are Anarchists. Forget that it is claimed that we propagated violence. Forget that something appeared in MOTHER EARTH when I was thousands of miles away, three years ago. Forget all that, and merely consider the evidence. Have we been engaged in a conspiracy? has that conspiracy been proven? have we committed overt acts? have those overt acts been proven? We for the defense say they have not been proven. And therefore your verdict must be not guilty.But whatever your decision, the struggle must go on. We are but the atoms in the incessant human struggle towards the light that shines in the darkness -- the Ideal of economic, political and spiritual liberation of mankind!Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,63," Carrie Chapman Catt - The CrisisCarrie Chapman CattThe Crisis delivered 7 September 1916, Atlanta, Georgia for flashI have taken for my subject, The Crisis, because I believe that a crisis has come in our movement which, if recognized and the opportunity seized with vigor, enthusiasm and will, means the final victory of our great cause in the very near future. I am aware that some suffragists do not share this belief; they see no signs nor symptoms today which were not present yesterday; no manifestations in the year 1916 which differ significantly from those in the year 1910. To them, the movement has been a steady, normal growth from the beginning and must so continue until the end. I can only defend my claim with the plea that it is better to imagine a crisis where none exists than to fail to recognize one when it comes; for a crisis is a culmination of events which calls for new considerations and new decisions. A failure to answer the call may mean an opportunity lost, a possible victory postponed.The object of the life of an organized movement is to secure its aim. Necessarily, it must obey the law of evolution and pass through the stages of agitation and education and finally through the stage of realization. As one has put it: A new idea floats in the air over the heads of the people and for a long, indefinite period evades their understanding but, by and by, when through familiarity, human vision grows clearer, it is caught out of the clouds and crystallized into law. Such a period comes to every movement and is its crisis. In my judgment, that crucial moment, bidding us to renewed consecration and redoubled activity has come to our cause. I believe our victory hangs within our grasp, inviting us to pluck it out of the clouds and establish it among the good things of the world.If this be true, the time is past when we should say: Men and women of America, look upon that wonderful idea up there; see, one day it will come down. Instead, the time has come to shout aloud in every city, village and hamlet, and in tones so clear and jubilant that they will reverberate from every mountain peak and echo from shore to shore: The woman's Hour has struck. Suppose suffragists as a whole do not believe a crisis has come and do not extend their hands to grasp the victory, what will happen? Why, we shall all continue to work and our cause will continue to hang, waiting for those who possess a clearer vision and more daring enterprise. On the other hand, suppose we reach out with united earnestness and determination to grasp our victory while it still hangs a bit too high? Has any harm been done? None!Therefore, fellow suffragists, I invite your attention to the signs which point to a crisis and your consideration of plans for turning the crisis into victory.First, we are passing through a world crisis. All thinkers of every land tell us so; and that nothing after the great war will be as it was before. Those who profess to know, claim that 100 millions of dollars are being spent on the war every day and that 2 years of war have cost 50 billions of dollars or 10 times more than the total expense of the American Civil War. Our own country has sent 35 millions of dollars abroad for relief expenses.Were there no other effects to come from the world's war, the transfer of such unthinkably vast sums of money from the usual avenues to those wholly abnormal would give so severe a jolt to organized society that it would vibrate around the world and bring untold changes in its wake.But three and a half millions of lives have been lost. The number becomes the more impressive when it is remembered that the entire population of the American Colonies was little more than three and one-half millions. These losses have been the lives of men within the age of economic production. They have been taken abruptly from the normal business of the world and every human activity from that of the humblest, unskilled labor to art, science and literature has been weakened by their loss. Millions of other men will go to their homes, blind, crippled and incapacitated to do the work they once performed.The stability of human institutions has never before suffered so tremendous a shock. Great men are trying to think out the consequences but one and all proclaim that no imagination can find color or form bold enough to paint the picture of the world after the war. British and Russian, German and Austrian, French and Italian agree that it will lead to social and political revolution throughout the entire world. Whatever comes, they further agree that the war presages a total change in the status of women.A simple-minded man in West Virginia, when addressed upon the subject of woman suffrage in that State, replied, We've been so used to keepin' our women down, 'twould seem queer not to. He expressed what greater men feel but do not say. Had the wife of that man spoken in the same clear-thinking fashion, she would have said, We women have been so used to being kept down that it would seem strange to get up. Nature intended women for door-mats. Had she so expressed herself, these two would have put the entire anti-suffrage argument in a nut-shell.In Europe, from the Polar Circle to the Aegean Sea, women have risen as though to answer that argument. Everywhere they have taken the places made vacant by men and in so doing, they have grown in self-respect and in the esteem of their respective nations. In every land, the people have reverted to the primitive division of labor and while the men have gone to war, women have cultivated the fields in order that the army and nation may be fed. No army can succeed and no nation can endure without food; those who supply it are a war power and a peace power.Women by the thousands have knocked at the doors of munition factories and, in the name of patriotism, have begged for the right to serve their country there. Their services were accepted with hesitation but the experiment once made, won reluctant but universal praise. An official statement recently issued in Great Britain announced that 660,000 women were engaged in making munitions in that country alone. In a recent convention of munition workers, composed of men and women, a resolution was unanimously passed informing the government that they would forego vacations and holidays until the authorities announced that their munition supplies were sufficient for the needs of the war and Great Britain pronounced the act the highest patriotism.Lord Derby addressed such a meeting and said, When the history of the war is written, I wonder to whom the greatest credit will be given; to the men who went to fight or to the women who are working in a way that many people hardly believed that it was possible for them to work. Lord Sydenham added his tribute. Said he, It might fairly be claimed that women have helped to save thousands of lives and to change the entire aspect of the war. Wherever intelligence, care and close attention have been needed, women have distinguished themselves. A writer in the London Times of July 18, 1916, said: But, for women, the armies could not have held the field for a month; the national call to arms could not have been made or sustained; the country would have perished of inanition and disorganization.If, indeed, it be true that the people have been one, it is because the genius of women has been lavishly applied to the task of reinforcing and complementing the genius of men. The qualities of steady industry, adaptability, good judgment and concentration of mind which men do not readily associate with women have been conspicuous features.On fields of battle, in regular and improvised hospitals, women have given tender and skilled care to the wounded and are credited with the restoration of life to many, heroism and self-sacrifice have been frankly acknowledged by all the governments; but their endurance, their skill, the practicality of their service, seem for the first time, to have been recognized by governments as war power. So, thinking in war terms, great men have suddenly discovered that women are war assets. Indeed, Europe is realizing, as it never did before, that women are holding together the civilization for which men are fighting. A great search-light has been thrown upon the business of nation-building and it has been demonstrated in every European land that it is a partnership with equal, but different responsibilities resting upon the two partners.It is not, however, in direct war work alone that the latent possibilities of women have been made manifest. In all the belligerent lands, women have found their way to high posts of administration where no women would have been trusted two years ago and the testimony is overwhelming that they have filled their posts with entire satisfaction to the authorities. They have dared to stand in pulpits (once too sacred to be touched by the unholy feet of a woman) and there, without protest, have appealed to the Father of All in behalf of their stricken lands. They have come out of the kitchen where there was too little to cook and have found a way to live by driving cabs, motors and streetcars. Many a woman has turned her hungry children over to a neighbor and has gone forth to find food for both mothers and both families of children and has found it in strange places and occupations. Many a drawing-room has been closed and the maid who swept and dusted it is now cleaning streets that the health of the city may be conserved. Many a woman who never before slept in a bed of her own making, or ate food not prepared by paid labor, is now sole mistress of parlor and kitchen.In all the warring countries, women are postmen [sic], porters, railway conductors, ticket, switch and signal men. Conspicuous advertisements invite women to attend agricultural, milking and motor-car schools. They are employed as police in Great Britain and women detectives have recently been taken on the government staff. In Berlin, there are over 3,000 women streetcar conductors and 3,500 women are employed on the general railways. In every city and country, women are doing work for which they would have been considered incompetent two years ago.The war will soon end and the armies will return to their native lands. To many a family, the men will never come back. The husband who returns to many a wife, will eat no bread the rest of his life save of her earning.What then, will happen after the war? Will the widows left with families to support cheerfully leave their well-paid posts for those commanding lower wages? Not without protest! Will the wives who now must support crippled husbands give up their skilled work and take up the occupations which were open to them before the war? Will they resignedly say: The woman who has a healthy husband who can earn for her, has a right to tea and raisin cake, but the woman who earns for herself and a husband who has given his all to his country, must be content with butterless bread?Not without protest!On the contrary, the economic axiom, denied and evaded for centuries, will be blazoned on every factory, counting house and shop: Equal pay for equal work; and common justice will slowly, but surely enforce that law. The European woman has risen. She may not realize it yet, but the woman door-mat in every land has unconsciously become a door-jamb! She will have become accustomed to her new dignity by the time the men come home. She will wonder how she ever could have been content lying across the threshold now that she discovers the upright jamb gives so much broader and more normal a vision of things. The men returning may find the new order a bit queer but everything else will be strangely unfamiliar too, and they will soon grow accustomed to all the changes together. The jamb will never descend into a door-mat again.The male and female anti-suffragists of all lands will puff and blow at the economic change which will come to the women of Europe. They will declare it to be contrary to Nature and to God's plan and that somebody ought to do something about it. Suffragists will accept the change as the inevitable outcome of an unprecedented world's cataclysm over which no human agency had any control and will trust in God to adjust the altered circumstances to the eternal evolution of human society. They will remember that in the long run, all things work together for good, for progress and for human weal.The economic change is bound to bring political liberty. From every land, there comes the expressed belief that the war will be followed by a mighty, oncoming wave of democracy for it is now well known that the conflict has been one of governments, of kings and Czars, Kaisers and Emperors; not of peoples. The nations involved have nearly all declared that they are fighting to make an end of wars. New and higher ideals of governments and of the rights of the people under them, have grown enormously during the past two years. Another tide of political liberty, similar to that of 1848, but of a thousandfold greater momentum, is rising from battlefield and hospital, from camp and munitions factory, from home and church which, great men of many lands, tell us, is destined to sweep over the world. On the continent, the women say, It is certain that the vote will come to men and women after the war, perhaps not immediately but soon.In Great Britain, which was the storm centre of the suffrage movement for some years before the war, hundreds of bitter, active opponents have confessed their conversion on account of the war services of women. Already, three great provinces of Canada, Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchawan [sic], have given universal suffrage to their women in sheer generous appreciation of their war work. Even Mr. Asquith, world renowned for his immovable opposition to the Parliamentary suffrage for British women, has given evidence of a change of view. Some months ago, he announced his amazement at the utterly unexpected skill, strength and resource developed by the women and his gratitude for their loyalty and devotion. Later, in reply to Mrs. Henry Fawcett, who asked if woman suffrage would be included in a proposed election bill, he said that when the war should end, such a measure would be considered without prejudice carried over from events prior to the war. A public statement issued by Mr. Asquith in August, was couched in such terms as to be interpreted by many as a pledge to include women in the next election bill.In Great Britain, a sordid appeal which may prove the last straw to break the opposition to woman suffrage, has been added to the enthusiastic appreciation of woman's patriotism and practical service and to the sudden comprehension that motherhood is a national asset which must be protected at any price. A new voters' list is contemplated. A parliamentary election should be held in September but the voters are scattered far and wide. The whole nation is agitated over the questions involved in making a new register. At the same time, there is a constant anxiety over war funds, as is prudent in a nation spending 50 millions of dollars per day. It has been proposed that a large poll tax be assessed upon the voters of the new lists, whereupon a secondary proposal of great force has been offered and that is, that twice as much money would find its way into the public coffers were women added to the voters' list. What nation, with compliments fresh spoken concerning women's patriotism and efficiency, could resist such an appeal?So it happens that above the roar of cannon, the scream of shrapnel and the whirr of aeroplanes, one who listens may hear the cracking of the fetters which have long bound the European woman to outworn conventions. It has been a frightful price to pay but the fact remains that a womanhood, well started on the way to final emancipation, is destined to step forth from the war. It will be a bewildered, troubled and grief-stricken womanhood with knotty problems of life to solve, but it will be freer to deal with them than women have ever been before.The Woman's Hour has struck. It has struck for the women of Europe and for those of all the world. The significance of the changed status of European women has not been lost upon the men and women of our land; our own people are not so unlearned in history, nor so lacking in National pride that they will allow the Republic to lag long behind the Empire, presided over by the descendant of George the Third. If they possess the patriotism and the sense of nationality which should be the inheritance of an American, they will not wait until the war is ended but will boldly lead in the inevitable march of democracy, our own American specialty. Sisters, let me repeat, the Woman's Hour has struck!Second, as the most adamantine rock gives way under the constant dripping of water, so the opposition to woman suffrage in our own country has slowly disintegrated before the increasing strength of our movement. Turn backward the pages of our history! Behold, brave Abbie Kelley rotten-egged because she, a woman, essayed to speak in public. Behold the Polish Ernestine Rose startled that women of free America drew aside their skirts when she proposed that they should control their own property. Recall the saintly Lucretia Mott and the legal-minded Elizabeth Cady Stanton, turned out of the World's Temperance convention in London and conspiring together to free their sex from the world's stupid oppressions. Remember the gentle, sweet-voiced Lucy Stone, egged because she publicly claimed that women had brains capable of education. Think upon Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, snubbed and boycotted by other women because she proposed to study medicine. Behold Dr. Antoinette Brown Blackwell, standing in sweet serenity before an Assembly of howling clergymen, angry that she, a woman dared to attend a Temperance Convention as a delegate. Revere the intrepid Susan B. Anthony mobbed from Buffalo to Albany because she demanded fair play for women. These are they who builded with others the foundation of political liberty for American women.Those who came after only laid the stones in place. Yet, what a wearisome task even that has been! Think of the wonderful woman who has wandered from village to village, from city to city, for a generation compelling men and women to listen and to reflect by her matchless eloquence. Where in all the world's history has any movement among men produced so invincible an advocate as our own Dr. Anna Howard Shaw? Those whom she has led to the light are Legion. Think, too, of the consecration, the self-denial, the never-failing constancy of that other noble soul set in a frail but unflinching body -- the heroine we know as Alice Stone Blackwell! A woman who never forgets, who detects the slightest flaw in the weapons of her adversary, who knows the most vulnerable spot in his armor, presides over the Woman's Journal and, like a lamp in a lighthouse, the rays of her intelligence, farsightedness and clear-thinking have enlightened the world concerning our cause. The names of hundreds of other brave souls spring to memory when we pause to review the long struggle.The hands of many suffrage master-masons have long been stilled; the names of many who laid the stones have been forgotten. That does not matter. The main thing is that the edifice of woman's liberty nears completion. It is strong, indestructible. All honor to the thousands who have helped in the building.The four Corner-stones of the foundations were laid long years ago. We read upon the first: We demand for women education, for not a high school or college is open to her; upon the second, We demand for women religious liberty for in few churches is she permitted to pray or speak; upon the third, We demand for women the right to own property and an opportunity to earn an honest living. Only six, poorly-paid occupations are open to her, and if she is married, the wages she earns are not hers; upon the fourth, We demand political freedom and its symbol, the vote.The stones in the foundation have long been overgrown with the moss and mould of time, and some there are who never knew they were laid. Of late, four cap-stones at the top have been set to match those in the base, and we read upon the first: The number of women who are graduated from high schools, colleges and universities is legion; upon the second, The Christian Endeavor, that mighty, undenominational church militant, asks the vote for the women and the Methodist Episcopal Church, and many another, joins that appeal; upon the third, Billions of dollars worth of property are earned and owned by women; more than 8 millions of women are wage-earners. Every occupation is open to them; upon the fourth: Women vote in 12 States; they share in the determination of 91 electoral votes.After the cap-stones and cornice comes the roof. Across the empty spaces, the rooftree has been flung and fastened well in place. It is not made of stone but of two planks -- planks in the platform of the two majority parties, and these are well supported by planks in the platforms of all minority parties.And we who are the builders of 1916, do we see a crisis? Standing upon these planks which are stretched across the top-most peak of this edifice of woman's liberty, what shall we do? Over our heads, up there in the clouds, but tantalizingly near, hangs the roof of our edifice -- the vote. What is our duty? Shall we spend time in admiring the capstones and cornice? Shall we lament the tragedies which accompanied the laying of the cornerstones? or, shall we, like the builders of old, chant, Ho! all hands, all hands, heave to! All hands, heave to! and while we chant, grasp the overhanging roof and with a long pull, a strong pull and a pull together, fix it in place forevermore?Is the crisis real or imaginary? If it be real, it calls for action, bold, immediate and decisive.Let us then take measure of our strength. Our cause has won the endorsement of all political parties. Every candidate for the presidency is a suffragist. It has won the endorsement of most churches; it has won the hearty approval of all great organizations of women. It was won the support of all reform movements; it has won the progressives of every variety. The majority of the press in most States is with us. Great men in every political party, church and movement are with us. The names of the greatest men and women of art, science, literature and philosophy, reform, religion and politics are on our lists. We have not won the reactionaries of any party, church or society, and we never will. From the beginning of things, there have been Antis. The Antis drove Moses out of Egypt; they crucified Christ who said, Love thy neighbor as thyself; they have persecuted Jews in all parts of the world; they poisoned Socrates, the great philosopher; they cruelly persecuted Copernicus and Galileo, the first great scientists; they burned Giordano Bruno at the stake because he believed the world was round; they burned Savonarola who warred upon church corruption; they burned Eufame McIlyane because she used an anaesthetic; they burned Joan d'Arc for a heretic; they have sent great men and women to Siberia to eat their hearts out in isolation; they burned in effigy William Lloyd Garrison; they egged Abbie Kelley and Lucy Stone and mobbed Susan B. Anthony. Yet, in proportion to the enlightenment of their respective ages, these Antis were persons of intelligence and honest purpose. They were merely deaf to the call of Progress and were enraged because the world insisted upon moving on. Antis male and female there still are and will be to the end of time. Give to them a prayer of forgiveness for they know not what they do; and prepare for the forward march.We have not won the ignorant and illiterate and we never can. They are too undeveloped mentally to understand that the institutions of today are not those of yesterday nor will be those of tomorrow.We have not won the forces of evil and we never will. Evil has ever been timorous and suspicious of all change. It is an instinctive act of self-preservation which makes it fear and consequently oppose votes for women. As the Hon. Champ Clark said the other day: Some good and intelligent people are opposed to woman suffrage; but all the ignorant and evil-minded are against it.These three forces are the enemies of our cause.Before the vote is won, there must and will be a gigantic final conflict between the forces of progress, righteousness and democracy and the forces of ignorance, evil and reaction. That struggle may be postponed, but it cannot be evaded or avoided. There is no question as to which side will be the victor.Shall we play the coward, then, and leave the hard knocks for our daughters, or shall we throw ourselves into the fray, bare our own shoulders to the blows, and thus bequeath to them a politically liberated womanhood? We have taken note of our gains and of our resources! and they are all we could wish. Before the final struggle, we must take cognizance of our weaknesses. Are we prepared to grasp the victory? Alas, no! our movement is like a great Niagara with a vast volume of water tumbling over its ledge but turning no wheel. Our organized machinery is set for the propagandistic stage and not for the seizure of victory. Our supporters are spreading the argument for our cause; they feel no sense of responsibility for the realization of our hopes. Our movement lacks cohesion, organization, unity and consequent momentum.Behind us, in front of us, everywhere about us are suffragists -- millions of them, but inactive and silent. They have been agitated and educated and are with us in belief. There are thousands of women who have at one time or another been members of our organization but they have dropped out because, to them the movement seemed negative and pointless. Many have taken up other work whose results were more immediate. Philanthropy, charity, work for corrective laws of various kinds, temperance, relief for working women and numberless similar public services have called them. Others have turned to the pleasanter avenues of clubwork, art or literature.There are thousands of other women who have never learned of the earlier struggles of our movement. They found doors of opportunity open to them on every side. They found well-paid posts awaiting the qualified woman and they have availed themselves of all these blessings; almost without exception they believe in the vote but they feel neither gratitude to those who opened the doors through which they have entered to economic liberty nor any sense of obligation to open other doors for those who come after.There are still others who, timorously looking over their shoulders to see if any listeners be near, will tell us they hope we will win and win soon but they are too frightened of Mother Grundy to help. There are others too occupied with the small things of life to help. They say they could find time to vote but not to work for the vote. There are men, too, millions of them, waiting to be called. These men and women are our reserves. They are largely unorganized and untrained soldiers with little responsibility toward our movement. Yet these reserves must be mobilized. The final struggle needs their numbers and the momentum those numbers will bring. Were never another convert made, there are suffragists enough in this country, if combined, to make so irresistible a driving force that victory might be seized at once.How can it be done? By a simple change of mental attitude. If we are to seize the victory, that change must take place in this hall, here and now!The old belief, which has sustained suffragists in many an hour of discouragement, woman suffrage is bound to come, must give way to the new, The Woman's Hour has struck. The long drawn out struggle, the cruel hostility which, for years was arrayed against our cause, have accustomed suffragists to the idea of indefinite postponement but eventual victory. The slogan of a movements sets its pace. The old one counseled patience; it said, there is plenty of time; it pardoned sloth and half-hearted effort. It set the pace of an educational campaign. The Woman's Hour has struck sets the pace of a crusade which will have its way. It says: Awake, arise, my sisters, let your hearts be filled with joy -- the time of victory is here. Onward March.If you believe with me that a crisis has come to our movement -- if you believe that the time for final action is now, if you catch the rosy tints of the coming day, what does it mean to you? Does it not give you a thrill of exaltation; does the blood not course more quickly through your veins; does it not bring a new sense of freedom, of joy and of determination? Is it not true that you who wanted a little time ago to lay down the work because you were weary with long service, now, under the compelling influence of a changed mental attitude, are ready to go on until the vote is won. The change is one of spirit! Aye, and the spiritual effect upon you will come to others.Let me borrow an expression from Honorable John Finlay: What our great movement needs now is a mobilization of spirit -- the jubilant, glad spirit of victory.Then let us sound a bugle call here and now to the women of the Nation: The Woman's Hour has struck. Let the bugle sound from the suffrage headquarters of every State at the inauguration of a State campaign. Let the call go forth again and, again and yet again. Let it be repeated in every article written, in every speech made, in every conversation held. Let the bugle blow again and yet again. The Political emancipation of our sex calls you: Women of America, arise! Are you content that others shall pay the price of your liberty? Women in schools and counting house, in shops and on the farm, women in the home with babes at their breasts and women engaged in public careers will hear. The veins of American women are not filled with milk and water. They are neither cowards nor slackers. They will come. They only await the bugle call to learn that the final battle is on.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Governor Collins you're much too kind, as all of you have been to me the last few days. It's been a great pleasure and an honor for me to meet so many of you. And I want to thank you for this opportunity to meet with you today.As you know, this is myfirst public address since I took over my new job. When the New Frontiersmen rode intotown, I locked myself in my office to do my homework and get my feet wet. But apparently Ihaven't managed yet to stay out of hot water. I seem to have detected a very nervousapprehension about what I might say or do when I emerged from that locked office for this,my maiden station break.So first let me begin by dispelling a rumor. I was not picked for thisjob because I regard myself as the fastest draw on the New Frontier. Second, let me starta rumor. Like you, I have carefully read President Kennedy's messages about the regulatoryagencies, conflict of interest, and the dangers of ex parte contacts. And, ofcourse, we at the Federal Communications Commission will do our part. Indeed, I may evensuggest that we change the name of the FCC to The Seven Untouchables.It may also come as a surprise to some of you, but I want you toknow that you have my admiration and my respect. Yours is a most honorable profession. Anyonewho is in the broadcasting business has a tough row to hoe. You earn your bread by usingpublic property. When you work in broadcasting you volunteer for public service, publicpressure, and public regulation. You must compete with other attractions and otherinvestments, and the only way you can do it is to prove to us every three years that youshould have been in business in the first place.I can think of easier ways to make a living.But I cannot think of more satisfying ways.I admire your courage -- but that doesn't mean that I would make life anyeasier for you. Your license lets you use the public's airwaves as trustees for 180million Americans. The public is your beneficiary. If you want to stay on as trustees, youmust deliver a decent return to the public -- not only to your stockholders. So, as arepresentative of the public, your health and your product are among my chief concerns.Now as to your health, let's talk only of television today. 1960 gross broadcast revenues of the television industry were over 1,268,000,000 dollars. Profitbefore taxes was 243,900,000 dollars, an average return on revenue of 19.2 per cent. Compare thesewith 1959, when gross broadcast revenues were 1,163,900,000 dollars, and profit before taxes was222,300,000, an average return on revenue of 19.1 per cent. So the percentage increaseof total revenues from '59 to '60 was 9 per cent, and the percentage increase of profitwas 9.7 per cent. This, despite a recession throughout the country. For your investors, the price has indeed beenright.So I have confidence in your health, but not in your product. It is with this and much more in mind that I come before you today.One editorialist in the trade press wrote that the FCC of theNew Frontier is going to be one of the toughest FCC's in the history of broadcastregulation. If he meant that we intend to enforce the law in the public interest,let me make it perfectly clear that he is right: We do. If he meant that we intend tomuzzle or censor broadcasting, he is dead wrong. It wouldn't surprise me if some of youhad expected me to come here today and say to you in effect, Clean up your own house or thegovernment will do it for you. Well, in a limited sense, you would be right because I'vejust said it.But I want to say to you as earnestly as I can that it is not in that spiritthat I come before you today, nor is it in that spirit that I intend to serve the FCC. Iam in Washington to help broadcasting, not to harm it; to strengthen it, not weaken it; toreward it, not to punish it; to encourage it, not threaten it; and to stimulate it, not censorit. Above all, I am here to uphold and protect the public interest.Now what do we mean by the public interest? Some say the public interest is merely what interests the public. I disagree. And so does your distinguished president, Governor Collins. In a recent speech -- and of course as I also told you yesterday -- In a recent speech he said,Broadcasting to serve the public interest, must have a soul and aconscience, a burning desire to excel, as well as to sell; the urge to build thecharacter, citizenship, and intellectual stature of people, as well as to expand the grossnational product. ...By no means do I imply that broadcasters disregard the publicinterest. ...But a much better job can be done, and should be done.I could not agree more with Governor Collins. And I would add that in today's world, with chaos in Laos and theCongo aflame, with Communist tyranny on our Caribbean doorstep, relentless pressures onour Atlantic alliance, with social and economic problems at home of the gravest nature,yes, and with the technological knowledge that makes it possible, as our President has said,not only to destroy our world but to destroy poverty around the world -- in a time of periland opportunity, the old complacent, unbalanced fare of action-adventure and situationcomedies is simply not good enough.Your industry possesses the most powerful voice in America. It hasan inescapable duty to make that voice ring with intelligence and with leadership. In afew years, this exciting industry has grown from a novelty to an instrument ofoverwhelming impact on the American people. It should be making ready for the kind ofleadership that newspapers and magazines assumed years ago, to make our people aware oftheir world.Ours has been called the jet age, the atomic age, the space age. Itis also, I submit, the television age. And just as history will decide whether the leadersof today's world employed the atom to destroy the world or rebuild it for mankind'sbenefit, so will history decide whether today's broadcasters employed their powerful voiceto enrich the people or to debase them.If I seem today to address myself chiefly to the problems oftelevision, I don't want any of you radio broadcasters to think that we've gone to sleep atyour switch. We haven't. We still listen. But in recent years most of the controversiesand cross-currents in broadcast programming have swirled around television. And so mysubject today is the television industry and the public interest.Like everybody, I wear more than one hat. I am the chairman of theFCC. But I am also a television viewer and the husband and father of other television viewers.I have seen a great many television programs that seemed to me eminently worthwhile and Iam not talking about the much bemoaned good old days of Playhouse 90 andStudio One.I'm talking about this past season. Some were wonderfullyentertaining, such as The Fabulous Fifties, The Fred Astaire Show,and The Bing Crosby Special; some were dramatic and moving, such as Conrad'sVictory and Twilight Zone; some were marvelously informative, suchas The Nation's Future, CBS Reports, The ValiantYears. I could list many more -- programs that I am sure everyone here felt enrichedhis own life and that of his family. When television is good, nothing -- not the theater,not the magazines or newspapers -- nothing is better.But when television is bad, nothing is worse. I invite each of you to sitdown in front of your television set when your station goes on the air and stay there, for a day, without a book, without a magazine, without a newspaper, without a profit and loss sheet or a rating book to distract you. Keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off. I can assure you thatwhat you will observe is a vast wasteland.You will see a procession of game shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood andthunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, western bad men, western good men, private eyes,gangsters, more violence, and cartoons. And endlessly, commercials -- many screaming,cajoling, and offending. And most of all, boredom. True, you'll see a few things youwill enjoy. But they will be very, very few. And if you think I exaggerate, I only ask you to try it.Is there one person in this room who claims that broadcasting can'tdo better? Well a glance at next season's proposed programming can give uslittle heart. Of 73 and 1/2 hours of prime evening time, the networks have tentativelyscheduled 59 hours of categories of action-adventure, situation comedy, variety, quiz, andmovies. Is there one network president in this room who claims he can't dobetter? Well, is there at least one network president who believes that theother networks can do better? Gentlemen, your trust accounting with your beneficiaries is long overdue. Never have so few owed so much to so many.Why is so much of television so bad? I've heard many answers:demands of your advertisers; competition for ever higher ratings; the need always toattract a mass audience; the high cost of television programs; the insatiable appetite forprogramming material. These are some of the reasons. Unquestionably, these are tough problemsnot susceptible to easy answers. But I am not convinced that you have tried hard enough to solvethem.I do not accept the idea that the present over-all programming isaimed accurately at the public taste. The ratings tell us only that some people have theirtelevision sets turned on and of that number, so many are tuned to one channel and so manyto another. They don't tell us what the public might watch if they were offered half-a-dozen additional choices. A rating, at best, is an indication of how many people saw whatyou gave them. Unfortunately, it does not reveal the depth of the penetration, or theintensity of reaction, and it never reveals what the acceptance would have been if whatyou gave them had been better -- if all the forces of art and creativity and daring andimagination had been unleashed. I believe in the people's good sense and good taste, and Iam not convinced that the people's taste is as low as some of you assume.My concern with the rating services is not with their accuracy.Perhaps they are accurate. I really don't know. What, then, is wrong with the ratings?It's not been their accuracy -- it's been their use.Certainly, I hope you will agree that ratings should have littleinfluence where children are concerned. The best estimates indicate that during the hoursof 5 to 6 P.M. sixty per cent of your audience is composed of children under twelve. Andmost young children today, believe it or not, spend as much time watching television asthey do in the schoolroom. I repeat -- let that sink in, ladies and gentlemen -- most young children today spendas much time watching television as they do in the schoolroom. It used to be said thatthere were three great influences on a child: home, school, and church. Today, there is afourth great influence, and you ladies and gentlemen in this room control it.If parents, teachers, and ministers conducted their responsibilitiesby following the ratings, children would have a steady diet of ice cream, school holidays,and no Sunday school. What about your responsibilities? Is there no room on television toteach, to inform, to uplift, to stretch, to enlarge the capacities of our children? Isthere no room for programs deepening their understanding of children in other lands? Isthere no room for a children's news show explaining something to them about the world attheir level of understanding? Is there no room for reading the great literature of thepast, for teaching them the great traditions of freedom? There are some fine children's shows,but they are drowned out in the massive doses of cartoons, violence, and more violence.Must these be your trademarks? Search your consciences and see if you cannot offer more toyour young beneficiaries whose future you guide so many hours each and every day.Now what about adult programming and ratings? You know, newspaperpublishers take popularity ratings too. And the answers are pretty clear: It is almost alwaysthe comics, followed by advice to the lovelorn columns. But, ladies and gentlemen, thenews is still on the front page of all newspapers; the editorials are not replaced by morecomics; and the newspapers have not become one long collection of advice to the lovelorn. Yetnewspapers do not even need a license from the government to be in business; they do not use public property. But in television, where your responsibilities as public trustees are soplain, the moment that the ratings indicate that westerns are popular there are newimitations of westerns on the air faster than the old coaxial cable could take us fromHollywood to New York. Broadcasting cannot continue to live by the numbers. Ratings oughtto be the slave of the broadcaster, not his master. And you and I both know -- You and I both know that therating services themselves would agree.Let me make clear that what I am talking about is balance. I believethat the public interest is made up of many interests. There are many people in this greatcountry and you must serve all of us. You will get no argument from me if you say that,given a choice between a western and a symphony, more people will watch the western. Ilike westerns too, but a steady diet for the whole country is obviouslynot in the public interest. We all know that people would more often prefer to beentertained than stimulated or informed. But your obligations are not satisfied if youlook only to popularity as a test of what to broadcast. You are not only in show business;you are free to communicate ideas as well as relaxation.And as Governor Collins said to you yesterday when he encouraged you to editorialize -- as you know the FCC has now encouraged editorializing for years. We want you to do this; we want you to editorialize, take positions. We only ask that you do it in a fair and a responsible manner. Those stations that have editorialized have demonstrated to you that the FCC will always encourage a fair and responsible clash of opinion. You must provide a wider range ofchoices, more diversity, more alternatives. It is not enough to cater to the nation'swhims; you must also serve the nation's needs. And I would add this: that if some of you persist in a relentlesssearch for the highest rating and the lowest common denominator, you may very well loseyour audience. Because, to paraphrase a great American who was recently my law partner,the people are wise, wiser than some of the broadcasters -- and politicians -- think.As you may have gathered, I would like to see television improved.But how is this to be brought about? By voluntary action by the broadcasters themselves?By direct government intervention? Or how?Let me address myself now to my role not as a viewer but as chairmanof the FCC. I could not if I would, chart for you this afternoon in detail all of theactions I contemplate. Instead, I want to make clear some of the fundamental principleswhich guide me.First: the people own the air. And they own it as much in prime eveningtime as they do at six o'clock Sunday morning. For every hour that the people give you --you owe them something. And I intend to see that your debt is paid with service.Second: I think it would be foolish and wasteful for us to continueany worn-out wrangle over the problems of payola, rigged quiz shows, and other mistakes ofthe past. There are laws on the books which we will enforce. But there is no chip on myshoulder. We live together in perilous, uncertain times; we face together staggeringproblems; and we must not waste much time now by rehashing the clichÌ©s of pastcontroversy. To quarrel over the past is to lose the future.Third: I believe in the free enterprise system. I want to -- I want to seebroadcasting improved, and I want you to do the job. I am proud to champion your cause. Itis not rare for American businessmen to serve a public trust. Yours is a special trustbecause it is imposed by law.Fourth: I will do all I can to help educational television. Thereare still not enough educational stations, and major centers of the country still lackusable educational channels. If there were a limited number of printing presses in thiscountry, you may be sure that a fair proportion of them would be put to educational use.Educational television has an enormous contribution to make to the future, and I intend togive it a hand along the way. If there is not a nation-wide educational television systemin this country, it will not be the fault of the FCC.Fifth: I am unalterably opposed to governmental censorship. Therewill be no suppression of programming which does not meet with bureaucratic tastes.Censorship strikes at the tap root of our free society.Sixth: I did not come to Washington to idly observe the squanderingof the public's airwaves. The squandering of our airwaves is no less important than thelavish waste of any precious natural resource. I intend to take the job of chairman of theFCC very seriously. I happen to believe in the gravity of my own particular sector of the NewFrontier. There will be times perhaps when you will consider that I take myself or my job tooseriously. Frankly, I don't care if you do. For I am convinced that either one takesthis job seriously -- or one can be seriously taken.Now how will these principles be applied? Clearly at the heart ofthe FCC's authority lies its power to license, to renew or fail to renew, or to revoke alicense. As you know, when your license comes up for renewal, your performance is comparedwith your promises. I understand that many people feel that in the past licenses wereoften renewed pro forma. I say to you now: renewal will not be pro forma inthe future. There is nothing permanent or sacred about a broadcast license.But simply matching promises and performance is not enough. I intendto do more. I intend to find out whether the people care. I intend to find out whether thecommunity which each broadcaster serves believes he has been serving the public interest.When a renewal is set down for a hearing, I intend, whenever possible, to hold awell-advertised public hearing, right in the community you have promised to serve. I wantthe people who own the air and the homes that television enters to tell you and the FCCwhat's been going on. I want the people -- if they're truly interested in the service yougive them -- to make notes, document cases, tell us the facts. And for those few of you whoreally believe that the public interest is merely what interests the public, I hope thatthese hearings will arouse no little interest.The FCC has a fine reserve of monitors -- almost 180 millionAmericans gathered around 56 million sets. If you want those monitors to be your friendsat court, it's up to you.Now some of you may say, Yes, but I still do not know where theline is between a grant of a renewal and the hearing you just spoke of. My answeris: Why should you want to know how close you can come to the edge of the cliff? What theCommission asks of you is to make a conscientious, good-faith effort to serve the publicinterest. Everyone of you serves a community in which the people would benefit byeducational, and religious, instructive and other public service programming. Every one of youserves an area which has local needs -- as to local elections, controversial issues, localnews, local talent. Make a serious, genuine effort to put on that programming. And when youdo, you will not be playing brinkmanship with the public interest.Now what I've been saying applies to the broadcast stations. Now a stationbreak for the networks -- and will last even longer than 40 seconds: You networks know your importance in this great industry. Today, more thanone half of all hours of television station programming comes from the networks; in primetime, this rises to more than three fourths of the available hours.You know that the FCC has been studying network operations for sometime. I intend to press this to a speedy conclusion with useful results. I can tell youright now, however, that I am deeply concerned with concentration of power in the hands ofthe networks. As a result, too many local stations have foregone any efforts at localprogramming, with little use of live talent and local service. Too many local stationsoperate with one hand on the network switch and the other on a projector loaded with oldmovies. We want the individual stations to be free to meet their legal responsibilities toserve their communities.I join Governor Collins in his views so well expressed to theadvertisers who use the public air. And I urge the networks to join him and undertake a veryspecial mission on behalf of this industry. You can tell your advertisers, This isthe high quality we are going to serve -- take it or other people will. If you think youcan find a better place to move automobiles, cigarettes, and soap, then go ahead and try. Tell your sponsors to be less concerned with costs per thousand andmore concerned with understanding per millions. And remind your stockholders that aninvestment in broadcasting is buying a share in public responsibility. The networks canstart this industry on the road to freedom from the dictatorship of numbers.But there is more to the problem than network influences on stationsor advertiser influences on networks. I know the problems networks face in trying to clearsome of their best programs -- the informational programs that exemplify public service.They are your finest hours, whether sustaining or commercial, whether regularly scheduledor special. These are the signs that broadcasting knows the way to leadership. They makethe public's trust in you a wise choice.They should be seen. As you know, we are readying for use new formsby which broadcast stations will report their programming to the Commission. You probablyalso know that special attention will be paid in these forms to reports of public serviceprogramming. I believe that stations taking network service should also be required toreport the extent of the local clearance of network public service programs, and whenthey fail to clear them, they should explain why. If it is to put on some outstandinglocal program, this is one reason. But if it is simply to run an old movie, that'san entirely different matter. And the Commission should consider such clearance reportscarefully when making up its mind about the licensee's over-all programming.We intend to move -- and as you know, and as I want to say publicly, the FCC was rapidlymoving in other new areas before the new Administration arrived in Washington. And I wantto pay my public respects to my very able predecessor, Fred Ford, and to my colleagues on theCommission, each of whom has welcomed me to the FCC with warmth and cooperation.We have approved an experiment with pay TV, and in New York we aretesting the potential of UHF broadcasting. Either or both of these may revolutionizetelevision. Only a foolish prophet would venture to guess the direction they will take,and their effect. But we intend that they shall be explored fully, for they are part ofbroadcasting's New Frontier. The questions surrounding pay TV are largely economic. Thequestions surrounding UHF are largely technological. We are going to give the infant -- the infant payTV a chance to prove whether it can offer a useful service; we are going to protect itfrom those who would strangle it in its crib.As for UHF, I'm sure you know about our test in the canyons of NewYork City. We will take every possible positive step to break through the allocationsbarrier into UHF. We will put this sleeping giant to use and in the years ahead we mayhave twice as many channels operating in cities where now there are only two or three. Wemay have a half dozen networks instead of three.I have told you that I believe in the free enterprise system. Ibelieve that most of television's problems stem from lack of competition. This is theimportance of UHF to me: with more channels on the air, we will be able to provide everycommunity with enough stations to offer service to all parts of the public. Programs witha mass market appeal required by mass product advertisers certainly will still beavailable. But other stations will recognize the need to appeal to more limited marketsand to special tastes. In this way, we can all have a much wider range of programs. Television should thrive on this competition, and the countryshould benefit from alternative sources of service to the public. And, Governor Collins,I hope the NAB will benefit from many new members.Another and perhaps the most important frontier: Television willrapidly join the parade into space. International television will be with us soon. No oneknows how long it will be until a broadcast from a studio in New York will be viewed inIndia as well as in Indiana, will be seen in the Congo as it is seen in Chicago. But assurely as we are meeting here today, that day will come; and once again our world willshrink.What will the people of other countries think of us when they seeour western bad men and good men punching each other in the jaw in between the shooting?What will the Latin American or African child learn of America from this greatcommunications industry? We cannot permit television in its present form to be our voiceoverseas. There is your challenge to leadership. You must reexamine somefundamentals of your industry. You must open your minds and open your hearts to thelimitless horizons of tomorrow. I can suggest some words that should serve to guide you:Television and all who participate in it are jointly accountableto the American public for respect for the special needs of children, for communityresponsibility, for the advancement of education and culture, for the acceptability of theprogram materials chosen, for decency and decorum in production, and for propriety inadvertising. This responsibility cannot be discharged by any given group of programs, butcan be discharged only through the highest standards of respect for the American home,applied to every moment of every program presented by television.Program materials should enlarge the horizons of the viewer,provide him with wholesome entertainment, afford helpful stimulation, and remind him ofthe responsibilities which the citizen has towards his society.Now those are not my words. They are yours. They are taken literally, verbatim,from your own Television Code. They reflect the leadership and aspirations of your owngreat industry. I urge you to respect them as I do. And I urge you to respect theintelligent and farsighted leadership of Governor LeRoy Collins, and to make this meetinga creative act. I urge you at this meeting and, after you leave, back home, at yourstations and your networks, to strive ceaselessly to improve your product and to betterserve your viewers, the American people.I hope that we at the FCC will not allow ourselves to become sobogged down in the mountain of papers, hearings, memoranda, orders, and the daily routinethat we close our eyes to this wider view of the public interest. And I hope that youbroadcasters will not permit yourselves to become so absorbed in the daily chase for ratings,sales, and profits that you lose this wider view. Now more than ever before inbroadcasting's history the times demand the best of all of us.We need imagination in programming, not sterility; creativity, notimitation; experimentation, not conformity; excellence, not mediocrity. Television isfilled with creative, imaginative people. You must strive to set them free.Television in its young life has had many hours of greatness -- itsVictory at Sea, its Army-McCarthy hearings, its Peter Pan, itsKraft Theaters, its See It Now, its Project 20, theWorld Series, its political conventions and campaigns, and the Great Debates. And it's hadits endless hours of mediocrity and its moments of public disgrace. There are estimatestoday that the average viewer spends about 200 minutes daily with television, while theaverage reader spends 38 minutes with magazines, 40 minutes with newspapers. Televisionhas grown faster than a teenager, and now it is time to grow up.What you gentlemen broadcast through the people's air affects thepeople's taste, their knowledge, their opinions, their understanding of themselves and oftheir world -- and their future.Just think for a moment of the impact of broadcasting in the past few days. Yesterday was one of the great days of my life. Last week the President asked me to ride over with him when he came to speak here at the NAB. And when I went to the White House he said, Do you think it would be a good idea to takeCommander Shepard? And, of course, I said it would be magnificent. And I was privileged to ride here yesterday in a car with the President and the Vice President, Commander and Mrs. Shepard. This was an unexpected, unscheduled stop. And Commander Shepard said to me, Where are we going? What is this group? And I said, This is the National Association of Broadcasters at its annual convention.This is the group, this is the industry that made it possible for millions of Americans to share with you that great moment in history; that his gallant flight was witnessed by millions of anxious Americans who saw in it an intimacy which they could achieve through no other medium, in no other way. It was one of your finest hours. The depth of broadcasting's contribution to public understanding of that event cannot be measured. And it thrilled me -- as a representative of the government that deals with this industry -- to say to Commander Shepard the group that he was about to see.I say to you ladies and gentlemen -- I remind you what the President said in his stirring inaugural. He said:Ask not what America can do for you; ask what you can do forAmerica.å_ I say to you ladies and gentlemen: Ask not what broadcasting can do for you; ask what you can do forbroadcasting. And ask what broadcasting can do for America.I urge you, I urge you to put the people's airwaves to the service of the peopleand the cause of freedom. You must help prepare a generation for great decisions. You musthelp a great nation fulfill its future.Do this! I pledge you our help.Thank you.Book/CDs by Michael E.

We loved him as a brother, and as a father, and as a son. From his parents,and from his older brothers and sisters -- Joe andKathleen and Jack-- he received an inspiration which he passed on to all of us. He gaveus strength in time of trouble, wisdom in time of uncertainty, and sharingin time of happiness. He will always be by our side. Love is not an easy feeling to put into words. Nor is loyalty, or trust,or joy. But he was all of these. He loved life completely and he livedit intensely. A few years back, Robert Kennedy wrote some words about his own fatherwhich expresses [sic] the way we in his familyfelt about him. He said of what his father meant to him, and I quote:""Whatit really all adds up to is love -- not love as it is described with suchfacility in popular magazines, but the kind of love that is affection andrespect, order and encouragement, and support. Our awareness of this wasan incalculable source of strength, and because real love is somethingunselfish and involves sacrifice and giving, we could not help but profitfrom it.""And he continued,""Beneath it all, he has tried to engender asocial conscience. There were wrongs which needed attention. There werepeople who were poor and needed help. And we have a responsibility to themand to this country. Through no virtues and accomplishments of our own,we have been fortunate enough to be born in the United States under themost comfortable conditions. We, therefore, have a responsibility to otherswho are less well off.""That is what Robert Kennedy was given. What he leaves to us is whathe said, what he did, and what he stood for. A speech he made to the youngpeople of South Africa on their Day of Affirmation in 1966 sums it up thebest, and I would like to read it now:   ""There is discrimination in this world and slavery and slaughter andstarvation. Governments repress their people; millions are trapped in povertywhile the nation grows rich and wealth is lavished on armaments everywhere.These are differing evils, but they are the common works of man. They reflectthe imperfection of human justice, the inadequacy of human compassion,our lack of sensibility towards the suffering of our fellows. But we canperhaps remember -- even if only for a time -- that those who live with us are our brothers; that they share with us the same short moment of life; that they seek -- as we do -- nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and happiness, winning what satisfaction and fulfillment they can. Surely, this bond of common faith, this bond of common goal, can begin to teach us something. Surely, we can learn, at least, to look at those around us as fellow men. And surely we can begin to work a little harder to bind up the wounds among us and to become in our own hearts brothers and countrymen once again. The answer is to rely on youth -- not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease. The cruelties and obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to the obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans. They cannot be moved by those who cling to a present that is already dying, who prefer the illusion of security to the excitement and danger that come with even the most peaceful progress.It is a revolutionary world we live in, and this generation at home and around the world has had thrust upon it a greater burden of responsibility than any generation that has ever lived. Some believe there is nothing one man or one woman can do against the enormous array of the world's ills. Yet many of the world's great movements, of thought and action, have flowed from the work of a single man.A young monk began the Protestant reformation;a young general extended an empire from Macedonia to the borders of the earth;a young woman reclaimed the territory of France; and it was ayoung Italian explorer who discovered the New World, and the 32 year-old Thomas Jefferson who [pro]claimed thatall men are created equal.These men moved the world, and so can we all. Few will have the greatnessto bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portionof events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the historyof this generation. *It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped.* Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.Few are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change. And I believe that in this generation those with the courage to enter the moral conflict will find themselves with companions in every corner of the globe.For the fortunate among us, there is the temptation to follow the easy and familiar paths of personal ambition and financial success so grandly spread before those who enjoy the privilege of education. But that is not the road history has marked out for us. Like it or not, we live in times of danger and uncertainty. But they are also more open to the creative energy of men than any other time in history. All of us will ultimately be judged, and as the years pass we will surely judge ourselves on the effort we have contributed to building a new world society and the extent to which our ideals and goals have shaped that event.*The future does not belong to those who are content with today, apathetic toward common problems and their fellow man alike, timid and fearful in the face of new ideas and bold projects. Rather it will belong to those who can blend vision, reason and courage in a personal commitment to the ideals and great enterprises of American Society.* Ourfuture may lie beyond our vision, but it is not completely beyond our control.It is the shaping impulse of America that neither fate nor nature nor theirresistible tides of history, but the work of our own hands, matched toreason and principle, that will determine our destiny. There is pride inthat, even arrogance, but there is also experience and truth. In any event,it is the only way we can live.""That is the way he lived. That is what he leaves us.My brother need not be idealized, or enlarged in death beyond what hewas in life; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who sawwrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw warand tried to stop it.Those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today, pray thatwhat he was to us and what he wished for others will some day come to passfor all the world.As he said many times, in many parts of this nation, to those he touchedand who sought to touch him:""Some men see things as they are and say why.I dream things that never were and say why not.""

Hill, and I am a professor of law at the University of Oklahoma. I was born on a farm in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma, in 1956. I am the youngest of 13 children. I had my early education in Okmulgee County. My father, Albert Hill, is a farmer in that area. My mother's name is Irma Hill. She is also a farmer and a housewife. My childhood was one of a lot of hard work and not much money, but it was one of solid family affection, as represented by my parents. I was reared in a religious atmosphere in the Baptist faith, and I have been a member of the Antioch Baptist Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma, since 1983. It is a very warm part of my life at the present time.For my undergraduate work, I went to Oklahoma State University and graduated from there in 1977. I am attaching to this statement a copy of my resume for further details of my education. Senator Biden: It will be included in the record as if read. Ms. Hill: Thank you. I graduated from the university with academic honors and proceeded to the Yale Law School, where I received my JD degree in 1980. Upon graduation from law school, I became a practicing lawyer with the Washington, DC, firm of Ward, Hardraker, and Ross.In 1981, I was introduced to now Judge Thomas by a mutual friend. Judge Thomas told me that he was anticipating a political appointment, and he asked if I would be interested in working with him. He was, in fact, appointed as Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights. After he was -- After he had taken that post, he asked if I would become his assistant, and I accepted that position. In my early period there, I had two major projects. The first was an article I wrote for Judge Thomas's signature on the education of minority students. The second was the organization of a seminar on high-risk students which was abandoned because Judge Thomas transferred to theEEOC where he became the chairman of that office. During this period at the Department of Education, my working relationship with Judge Thomas was positive. I had a good deal of responsibility and independence. I thought he respected my work and that he trusted my judgment. After approximately three months of working there, he asked me to go out socially with him.What happened next and telling the world about it are the two most difficult things -- experiences of my life. It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration and sleepless number -- a great number of sleepless nights that I am able to talk of these unpleasant matters to anyone but my close friends. I declined the invitation to go out socially with him and explained to him that I thought it would jeopardize at what -- at -- at the time I considered to be a very good working relationship. I had a normal social life with other men outside of the office. I believed then, as now, that having a social relationship with a person who was supervising my work would be ill-advised. I was very uncomfortable with the idea and told him so. I thought that by saying no and explaining my reasons my employer would abandon his social suggestions. However, to my regret, in the following few weeks, he continued to ask me out on several occasions. He pressed me to justify my reasons for saying no to him. These incidents took place in his office or mine. They were in the form of private conversations which not -- would not have been overheard by anyone else. My working relationship became even more strained when Judge Thomas began to use work situations to discuss sex. On these occasions, he would call me into his office for reports on education issues and projects, or he might suggest that, because of the time pressures of his schedule, we go to lunch to a government cafeteria. After a brief discussion of work, he would turn the conversation to a discussion of sexual matters.His conversations were very vivid. He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts. On several occasions, Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess.Because I was extremely uncomfortable talking about sex with him at all, and particularly in such a graphic way, I told him that I did not want to talk about these subjects. I would also try to change the subject to education matters or to nonsexual personal matters such as his background or his beliefs. My efforts to change the -- the subject were rarely successful.Throughout the period of these conversations, he also, from time to time, asked me for social engagements. My reaction to these conversations was to avoid them by eliminating opportunities for us to engage in extended conversations. This was difficult because at the time I was his only assistant at the Office of Education -- or Office for Civil Rights.During the latter part of my time at the Department of Education, the social pressures and any conversation of his offensive behavior ended. I began both to believe and hope that our working relationship could be a proper, cordial, and professional one.When Judge Thomas was made chair of the EEOC, I needed to face the question of whether to go with him. I was asked to do so, and I did. The work itself was interesting, and at that time it appeared that the sexual overtures which had so troubled me had ended. I also faced the realistic fact that I had no alternative job. While I might have gone back to private practice, perhaps in my old firm or at another, I was dedicated to civil rights work, and my first choice was to be in that field. Moreover, the Department of Education itself was a dubious venture. President Reagan was seeking to abolish the entire department.For my first months at the EEOC, where I continued to be an assistant to Judge Thomas, there were no sexual conversations or overtures. However, during the fall and winter of 1982, these began again. The comments were random and ranged from pressing me about why I didn't go out with him to remarks about my personal appearance. I remember his saying that some day I would have to tell him the real reason that I wouldn't go out with him.He began to show displeasure in his tone and voice and his demeanor and his continued pressure for an explanation. He commented on what I was wearing in terms of whether it made me more or less sexually attractive. The incidents occurred in his inner office at the EEOC.One of the oddest episodes I remember was an occasion in which Thomas was drinking a Coke in his office. He got up from the table at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the Coke, looked at the can and asked, Who has pubic hair on my Coke? On other occasions, he referred to the size of his own penis as being larger than normal, and he also spoke on some occasions of the pleasures he had given to women with oral sex.At this point, late 1982, I began to feel severe stress on the job. I began to be concerned that Clarence Thomas might take out his anger with me by degrading me or not giving me important assignments. I also thought that he might find an excuse for dismissing me.In January of 1983, I began looking for another job. I was handicapped because I feared that, if he found out, he might make it difficult for me to find other employment and I might be dismissed from the job I had. Another factor that made my search more difficult was that there was a period -- this was during a period of a hiring freeze in the government. In February 1983, I was hospitalized for five days on an emergency basis for an acute -- for acute stomach pain, which I attributed to stress on the job.Once out of the hospital, I became more committed to find other employment and sought further to minimize my contact with Thomas. This became easier when Allison Duncan became office director, because most of my work was then funneled through her and I had contact with Clarence Thomas mostly in staff meetings.In the spring of 1983, an opportunity to teach at Oral Roberts University opened up. I participated in a seminar -- taught an afternoon session and seminar at Oral Roberts University. The dean of the -- of the university saw me teaching and inquired as to whether I would be interested in furthering -- pursuing a career in teaching, beginning at Oral Roberts University. I agreed to take the job in large part because of my desire to escape the pressures I felt at the EEOC, due to Judge Thomas.When I informed him that I was leaving in July, I recall that his response was that now I would no longer have an excuse for not going out with him. I told him that I still preferred not to do so. At some time after that meeting, he asked if he could take me to dinner at the end of the term. When I declined, he assured me that the dinner was a professional courtesy only and not a social invitation. I reluctantly agreed to accept that invitation, but only if it was at the very end of a working day.On, as I recall, the last day of my employment at the EEOC in the summer of 1983, I did have dinner with Clarence Thomas. We went directly from work to a restaurant near the office. We talked about the work I had done, both at Education and at the EEOC. He told me that he was pleased with all of it except for an article and speech that I had done for him while we were at the Office for Civil Rights. Finally, he made a comment that I will vividly remember. He said that if I ever told anyone of his behavior that it would ruin his career. This was not an apology, nor was it an explanation. That was his last remark about the possibility of our going out or reference to his behavior. In July of 1983, I left Washington, D.C. area and I've had minimal contacts with Judge Clarence Thomas since. I am of course aware from the Press that some questions have been raised about conversations I had with Judge Clarence Thomas after I left the EEOC. From 1983 until today, I have seen Judge Thomas only twice. On one occasion, I needed to get a reference from him, and on another he made a public appearance in Tulsa. On one occasion he called me at home and we had an inconsequential conversation. On one occasion he called me without reaching me, and I returned the call without reaching him, and nothing came of it. I have, on at least three occasions, been asked to [act] as a conduit to him for others.I knew his secretary, Diane Holt. We had worked together at both EEOC and Education. There were occasions on which I spoke to her, and on some of these occasions undoubtedly I passed on some casual comment to then Chairman Thomas. There were a series of calls in the first three months of 1985, occasioned by a group in Tulsa, which wished to have a civil rights conference. They wanted Judge Thomas to be the speaker and enlisted my assistance for this purpose. I did call in January and February to no effect, and finally suggested to the person directly involved, Susan Cahall, that she put the -- that she put the matter into her own hands and call directly. She did so in March of 1985. In connection with that March invitation, Ms. Cahall wanted conference materials for the seminar and some research was needed. I was asked to try to get the information and did attempt to do so. There was another call about another possible conference in the July of 1985. In August of 1987, I was in Washington, D.C. and I did call Diane Holt. In the course of this conversation, she asked me how long I was going to be in town and I told her. It is recorded in the message as August 15. It was, in fact, August 20th. She told me about Judge Thomas's marriage and I did say, Congratulate him. It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration that I am able to talk of these unpleasant matters to anyone except my closest friends. As I've said before these last few days have been very trying and very hard for me, and it hasn't just been the last few days this week. It has actually been over a month now that I have been under the strain of this issue. Telling the world is the most difficult experience of my life, but it is very close to having to live through the experience that occasion this meeting. I may have used poor judgment early on in my relationship with this issue. I was aware, however, that telling at any point in my career could adversely affect my future career. And I did not want early on to burn all the bridges to the EEOC. As I said, I may have used poor judgment. Perhaps I should have taken angry or even militant steps, both when I was in the agency, or after I left it. But I must confess to the world that the course that I took seemed the better as well as the easier approach. I declined any comment to newspapers, but later when Senate staff asked me about these matters I felt I had a duty to report. I have no personal vendetta against Clarence Thomas. I seek only to provide the committee with information which it may regard as relevant. It would have been more comfortable to remain silent. It took no initiative to inform anyone -- I took no initiative to inform anyone. But when I was asked by a representative of this committee to report my experience, I felt that I had to tell the truth. I could not keep silent. Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,67," Woodrow Wilson -- Final Address in Support of the League of NationsWoodrow WilsonFinal Address in Support of the League of Nations delivered 25 Sept 1919 in Pueblo, CO for flashMr. Chairman and fellow countrymen: It is with a great deal ofgenuine pleasure that I find myself in Pueblo, and I feel it a compliment in thisbeautiful hall. One of the advantages of this hall, as I look about, is that you are nottoo far away from me, because there is nothing so reassuring to men who are trying toexpress the public sentiment as getting into real personal contact with their fellowcitizens. I have gained a renewed impression as I have crossed the continent this time ofthe homogeneity of this great people to whom we belong. They come from many stocks, butthey are all of one kind. They come from many origins, but they are all shot through withthe same principles and desire the same righteous and honest things. I have received amore inspiring impression this time of the public opinion of the United States than it wasever my privilege to receive before.The chief pleasure of my trip has been that it has nothing to dowith my personal fortunes, that it has nothing to do with my personal reputation, that ithas nothing to do with anything except great principles uttered by Americans of all sortsand of all parties which we are now trying to realize at this crisis of the affairs of theworld. But there have been unpleasant impressions as well as pleasant impressions, myfellow citizens, as I have crossed the continent. I have perceived more and more that menhave been busy creating an absolutely false impression of what the treaty of peace and theCovenant of the League of Nations contain and mean. I find, moreover, that there is anorganized propaganda against the League of Nations and against the treaty proceeding fromexactly the same sources that the organized propaganda proceeded from which threatenedthis country here and there with disloyalty, and I want to say -- I cannot say toooften -- any man who carries a hyphen about with him carries a dagger that he is ready toplunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready. If I can catch any man with a hyphen in this great contest I willknow that I have got an enemy of the Republic. My fellow citizens, it is only certainbodies of foreign sympathies, certain bodies of sympathy with foreign nations that areorganized against this great document which the American representatives have brought backfrom Paris. Therefore, in order to clear away the mists, in order to remove theimpressions, in order to check the falsehoods that have clustered around this greatsubject, I want to tell you a few very simple things about the treaty and the covenant.Do not think of this treaty of peace as merely a settlement withGermany. It is that. It is a very severe settlement with Germany, but there is notanything in it that she did not earn. Indeed, she earned more than she can ever be able topay for, and the punishment exacted of her is not a punishment greater than she can bear,and it is absolutely necessary in order that no other nation may ever plot such a thingagainst humanity and civilization. But the treaty is so much more than that. It is notmerely a settlement with Germany; it is a readjustment of those great injustices whichunderlie the whole structure of European and Asiatic society. This is only the first ofseveral treaties. They are all constructed upon the same plan. The Austrian treaty followsthe same lines. The treaty with Hungary follows the same lines. The treaty with Bulgariafollows the same lines. The treaty with Turkey, when it is formulated, will follow thesame lines. What are those lines? They are based upon the purpose to see thatevery government dealt with in this great settlement is put in the hands of the people andtaken out of the hands of coteries and of sovereigns, who had no right to rule over thepeople. It is a people&#146;s treaty, that accomplishes by a great sweep of practicaljustice the liberation of men who never could have liberated themselves, and the power ofthe most powerful nations ahs been devoted not to their aggrandizement but to theliberation of people whom they could have put under their control if they had chosen to doso. Not one foot of territory is demanded by submission to their authority is demanded bythem. The men who sat around the table in Paris knew that the time had come when thepeople were no longer going to consent to live under masters, but were going to live thelives that they chose themselves, to live under such governments as they chose themselvesto erect. That is the fundamental principle of this great settlement.And we did not stop with that. We added a great internationalcharter for the rights of labor. Reject this treaty, impair it, and this is theconsequence of the laboring men of the world, that there is no international tribunalwhich can bring the moral judgments of the world to bear upon the great labor questions ofthe day. What we need to do with regard to the labor questions of the day, my fellowcountrymen, is to lift them into the light, is to lift them out of the haze anddistraction of passion, of hostility, out into the calm spaces where men look at thingswithout passion. The more men you get into a great discussion the more you excludepassion. Just as soon as the calm judgment of the worlds is directed upon the question ofjustice to labor, labor is going to have to forum such as it never was supplied withbefore, and men everywhere are going to see that the problem of labor is nothing more notless than the problem of the elevation of humanity. We must see that all the questionswhich have disturbed the world, all the questions which have disturbed the processes ofindustry, shall be brought out where men of all points of view, Men of all attitudes ofmind, men of all kinds of experience, may contribute their part of the settlement of thegreat questions which we must settle and cannot ignore.At the front of this great treaty is put the Covenant of the Leagueof Nations. It will also be at the front of the Austrian treaty and the Hungarian treatyand the Bulgarian treaty and the treaty with Turkey. Every one of them will contain theCovenant of the League of Nations, because you cannot work any of them without theCovenant of the League of Nations. Unless you get the united, concerted purpose and powerof the great Governments of the world behind this settlement, it will fall down like ahouse of cards. There is only one power to put behinds the liberation of mankind, and thatis the power of mankind. It is the power of the united moral forces of the world, and inthe Covenant of the League of Nations the moral forces of the world are mobilized. For what purpose? Reflect, my fellow citizens, that the membershipof this great League is going to include all the great fighting nations of the world, aswell as the weak ones. It is not for the present going to include Germany, but for thetime being Germany is not a great fighting country. All the nations that have power thatcan be mobilized are going to be members of this League, including the United States. And what do they unite for? They enter into a solemn promise to oneanother they will never use their power against one another for aggression; that theynever will impair the territorial integrity of a neighbor; that they never will interferewith the political independence of a neighbor; that they will abide by the principle thatgreat populations are entitled to determine their own destiny and that they will notinterfere with that destiny; and that no matter what differences arise amongst them theywill never resort to war without first having done one or other of two things -- eithersubmitted the matter of controversy to arbitration, in which case they agree to abide bythe result without question, or submitted it to the consideration of the council of theLeague of Nations, laying before that council all the documents, all the facts, agreeingthat the council can publish the documents, all the facts, agreeing that the council canpublish the documents and the facts to the whole world, agreeing that there shall be sixmonths allowed for the mature consideration of those facts by the council, and agreeingthat at the expiration of the six months, even if they are not then ready to accept theadvice of the council with regard to the settlement of the dispute, they will still not goto war for another three months. In other words, they consent, no matter what happens, to submitevery matter of difference between them to the judgment of mankind, and just so certainlyas they do that, my fellow citizens, war will be in the far background, war will be pushedout of that foreground of terror in which it has kept the world for generation aftergeneration, and men will know that there will be a calm time of deliberate counsel. Themost dangerous thing for a bad cause is to expose it to the opinion of the world. The mostcertain way that you can prove that a man is mistaken is by letting all his neighbors knowwhat he thinks, by letting all his neighbors know what he thinks, by letting all hisneighbors discuss what he thinks, and if he is in the wrong you will notice that he willstay at home, he will not walk on the street. He will be afraid of the eyes of hisneighbors. He will be afraid of their judgment of his character. He will know that hiscause is lost unless he can sustain it by the arguments of right and of justice. The samelaw that applies to individuals applies to nations. But, you say, &#147;We have heard that we might be at a disadvantagein the League of Nations.&#148; Well, whoever told you that either was deliberatelyfalsifying or he had not read the Covenant of the League of Nations. I leave him thechoice. I want to give you a very simple account of the organization of the League ofNations and let you judge for yourselves. It is a very simple organization. The power ofthe League, or rather the activities of the league, lie in two bodies. There is thecouncil, which consists of one representative from each of the principal allied andassociated powers -- that is to say, the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, andJapan, along with four other representatives of smaller powers chosen out of the generalbody of the membership of the League. The council is the source of very active policy of the League, andno active policy of the League can be adopted without a unanimous vote of the council.That is explicitly stated in the Covenant itself. Does it not evidently follow that theLeague of Nations can adopt no policy whatever without the consent of the United States?The affirmative vote of the representative of the United States is necessary in everycase. Now, you have heard of six votes belonging to the British Empire. Those six votesare not in the council. They are in the assembly, and the interesting thing is that theassembly does not vote. I must qualify that statement a little, but essentially it isabsolutely true. In every matter in which the assembly is given a voice, and there areonly four or five, its vote does not count unless concurred in by the representatives ofall the nations represented on the council, so the at there is no validity to any vote ofthe assembly unless in that vote also the representative of the United States concurs.That one vote of the United States is as big as the six votes of the British Empire. I amnot jealous for advantage, my fellow citizens, but I think that is a perfectly safesituation. There is no validity in a vote, either by the council or the assembly, in whichwe do not concur. So much for the statements about the six votes for the British Empire.Look at it in another aspect. The assembly is the talking body. Theassembly was created in order that anybody that purposed anything wrong should besubjected to the awkward circumstance that everybody could talk about it. This is thegreat assembly in which all the things that are likely to disturb the peace of the worldor the good understanding between nations are to be exposed to the general view, and Iwant to ask you if you think it was unjust, unjust to the United States, that speakingparts should be assigned to the several portions of the British Empire? Do you think itunjust that there should be some spokesman in debate for that fine little stout Republicdown in the Pacific, New Zealand? Do you think it was unjust that Australia should beallowed to stand up and take part in the debate -- Australia, from which we have learnedsome of the most useful progressive policies of modern time, a little nation only fivemillion in a great continent, but counting for several times five in its activities and inits interest in liberal reform? Do you think it unjust that that little Republic down inSouth Africa, whose gallant resistance to being subjected to any outside authority at allwe admired for so many months and whose fortunes we followed with such interest, shouldhave a speaking part? Great Britain obliged South Africa to submit to her sovereignty, butshe immediately after that felt that it was convenient and right to hand the wholeself-government of that colony over to the very men whom she had beaten. The representatives of South Africa in Paris were two of the mostdistinguished generals of the Boer Army, two of the realest men I ever met, two men thatcould talk sober counsel and wise advice, along with the best statesmen in Europe. Toexclude Gen. Botha and Gen. Smuts from the right to stand up in the parliament of theworld and say something concerning the affairs of mankind would be absurd. And what aboutCanada? Is not Canada a good neighbor? I ask you is not Canada more likely to agree withthe United States than with Great Britain? Canada has a speaking part. And then, for thefirst time in the history of the world, that great voiceless multitude, that thronghundreds of millions strong in India, has a voice, and I want to testify that some of thewisest and most dignified figures in the peace conference at Paris came form India, menwho seemed to carry in their minds an older wisdom than the rest of us had, whosetraditions ran back into so many of the unhappy fortunes of mankind that they seemed veryuseful counselors as to how some ray of hope and some prospect of happiness could beopened to its people. I for my part have no jealousy whatever of those five speaking partsin the assembly. Those speaking parts cannot translate themselves into five votes that canin any matter override the voice and purpose of the United States.Let us sweep aside all this language of jealousy. Let us be bigenough to know the facts and to welcome the facts, because the facts are based upon theprinciple that America has always fought for, namely, the equality of self-governingpeoples, whether they were big or little -- not counting men, but counting rights, notcounting representation, but counting the purpose of that representation. When you hear anopinion quoted you do no count the number of persons who hold it; you ask, &#147;Who saidthat?&#148; You weigh opinions, you do not count them, and the beauty of all democraciesis that every voice can be heard, every voice can have its effect, every voice cancontribute to the general judgment that is finally arrived at. That is the object ofdemocracy. Let us accept what America has always fought for, and accept it with pride thatAmerica showed the way and made the proposal. I do not mean that America made the proposalin this particular instance; I mean that the principle was an American principle, proposedby America.When you come to the heart of the Covenant, my fellow citizens, youwill find it in article ten, and I am very much interested to know that the other thingshave been blown away like bubbles. There is nothing in the other contentions with regardto the league of nations, but there is something in article ten that you ought to realizeand ought to accept or reject. Article ten is the heart of the whole matter. What isarticle ten? I never am certain that I can from memory give a literal repetition of itslanguage, but I am sure that I can give an exact interpretation of its meaning. Articleten provides that every member of the league covenants to respect and preserve theterritorial integrity and existing political independence of every other member of theleague as against external aggression. Not against internal disturbance. There was not aman at that table who did not admit the sacredness of the right of self-determination, thesacredness of the right of any body of people to say that they would not continue to liveunder the Government they were then living under, and under article eleven of the Covenantthey are given a place to say whether they will live under it or not. For followingarticle ten is article eleven, which makes it the right of any member of the League at anytime to call attention to anything, anywhere, that is likely to disturb the peace of theworld or the good understanding between nations upon which the peace of the world depends.I want to give you an illustration of what that would mean. You have heard a great deal -- something that was true and a greatdeal that was false--about the provision of the treaty which hands over to Japan therights which Germany enjoyed in the Province of Shantung in China. In the first place,Germany did not enjoy any rights there that other nations had not already claimed. For mypart, my judgment, my moral judgment, is against the whole set of concessions. They wereall of them unjust to China, they ought never to have been exacted, they were all exactedby duress, from a great body of thoughtful and ancient and helpless people. There neverwas any right in any of them. Thank God, America never asked for any, never dreamed ofasking for any. But when Germany got this concession in 1898, the Government of theUnited States made no protest whatever. That was not because the Government of the UnitedStates was not in the hands of thigh-minded and conscientious men. It was. WilliamMcKinley was President and John Hay was Secretary of State -- as safe hands to leave thehonor of the United States in as any that you can cite. They made no protest because thestate of international law a that time was that it was none of their business unless theycould show that the interests of the United States were affected, and the only think thatthey could show with regard to the interests of the United States was that Germany mightclose the doors of Shantung Province against the trade of the United States. They, therefore, demanded and obtained promises that we couldcontinue to sell merchandise in Shantung. Immediately following that concession to Germanythere was a concession to Russia of the same sort, of Port Arthur, and Port Arthur washanded over subsequently to Japan on the very territory of the United States. Don&#146;tyou remember that when Russia and Japan got into war with one another the war was broughtto a confusion by a treaty written at Portsmouth, N.H., and in that treaty without theslightest intimation from any authoritative sources in America that the Government of theUnited States had any objection, Port Arthur, Chinese territory, was turned over to Japan?I want you distinctly to understand that there is no thought of criticism in my mind. I amexpounding to you a state of international law. Now, read articles ten and eleven. You will see that internationallaw is revolutionized by putting morals into it. Article ten says that no member of theLeague, and that includes all these nations that have demanded these things unjustly ofChina, shall impair the territorial integrity or the political independence of any othermember of the League. China is going to be a member of the League. Article eleven saysthat nay member of the League can call attention to anything that is likely to disturb thepeace of the world or the good understanding between nations, and China is for the firsttime in the history of mankind afforded a standing before the jury of the world. I, for mypart, have a profound sympathy for China, and I am proud to have taken part in anarrangement which promises the protection of the world to the rights o China. The wholeatmosphere of the world is changed by a thing like that, my fellow citizens. The wholeinternational practice of the world is revolutionized.But, you will say, &#147;What is the second sentence of article ten?That is what gives very disturbing thoughts.&#148; The second sentence is that the councilof the League shall advise what steps, if any, are necessary to carry out the guaranty ofthe first sentence, namely, that the members will respect and preserve the territorialintegrity and political independence of the other members. I do not know any other meaningfor the word &#147;advise&#148; except &#147;advise.&#148; The council advises, and itcannot advise without the vote of the United States. Why gentlemen should fear that theCongress of the United States would be advised to do something that it did not want to doI frankly cannot imagine, because they cannot even be advised to do anything unless theirown representative has participated in the advice. It may be that that will impair somewhat the vigor of the League,but, nevertheless, the fact is so, that we are not obliged to take any advice except ourown, which to any man who wants to go his own course is a very satisfactory state ofaffairs. Every man regards his own advice as best, and I dare say every man mixes his ownadvice with some thought of his own interest. Whether we use it wisely or unwisely, we canuse the vote of the United States to make impossible drawing the United States into anyenterprise that she does not care to be drawn into.Yet article ten strikes at the taproot of war. Article ten is astatement that the very things that have always been sought in imperialistic wars arehenceforth foregone by every ambitious nation in the world. I would have felt very muchdisturbed if, sitting at the peace table in Paris, I had supposed that I was expounding myown ideas. Whether you believe it or not, I know the relative size of my own ideas; I knowhow they stand related in bulk and proportion to the moral judgments of my fellowcountrymen, and I proposed nothing whatever at the peace table at Paris that I had notsufficiently certain knowledge embodied the moral judgment of the citizens of the UnitedStates. I had gone over there with, so to say, explicit instruction. Don&#146;t youremember that we laid down fourteen points which should contain the principles of thesettlement? They were not my points. In every one of them I was conscientiously trying toread the thought of the people of the United States, and after I uttered those points Ihad every assurance given me that could be given me that they did speak the moral judgmentof the United States and not my single judgment. Then when it came to that critical period just a little less than ayear ago, when it was evident that the war was coming to its critical end, all the nationsengaged in the war accepted those fourteen principles explicitly as the basis of thearmistice and the basis of the peace. In those circumstances I crossed the ocean underbond to my own people and to the other governments with which I was dealing. The wholespecification of the method of settlement was written down and accepted before hand, andwe were architects building on those specifications. It reassures me and fortifies myposition to find how before I went over men whose judgment the United States has oftentrusted were of exactly the same opinion that I went abroad to express. Here is somethingI want to read from Theodore Roosevelt:&#147;The one effective move for obtaining peace is by an agreementamong all the great powers in which each should pledge itself no only to abide by thedecisions of a common tribunal but to back its decisions by force. The great civilizednations should combine by solemn agreement in a great would league for the peace ofrighteousness; a court should be established. A changed and amplified Hague court wouldmeet the requirements, composed of representatives from each nation, whose representativesare sworn to act as judges in each case and not in a representative capacity.&#148; Nowthere is article ten. He goes on and says this: &#147;The nations should agree on certainrights that should not be questioned, such as territorial integrity, their right to dealwith their domestic affairs, and with such matters as whom they should admit tocitizenship. All such guarantee each of their number in possession of these rights.&#148;Now, the other specification is the Covenant. The Covenant inanother portion guarantees to the members the independent control of their domesticquestions. There is not a leg of these gentlemen to stand on when they say that theinterests of the United States are not safeguarded in the very points where we are mostsensitive. You do not need to be told again that the Covenant expressly says that nothingin this covenant shall be construed as affecting the validity of the Monroe doctrine forexample. You could not be more explicit than that. And every point of interest is covered,partly for one very interesting reason. This is not the first time that the ForeignRelations Committee of the Senate of the United States ahs read and considered thiscovenant. I bought it to this country in March last in a tentative, provisional form, inpractically the form that it now has, with the exception of certain additions which Ishall mention immediately. I asked the Foreign Relations Committees of both Houses to cometo the White House and we spent a long evening in the frankest discussion of every portionthat they wished to discuss. They made certain specific suggestions as to what should becontained in this document when it was to be revised. I carried those suggestions toParis, and every one of them was adopted. What more could I have done? What more couldhave been obtained? The very matters upon which these gentlemen were most concerned were,the right of withdrawal, which is now expressly stated; the safeguarding of the Monroedoctrine, whish is now accomplished/; the exclusion from action by the League of domesticquestions, which is now accomplished. All along the line, every suggestion of the UnitedStates was adopted after the Covenant had been drawn up in its first form and had beenpublished of the criticism of the world. There is a very true sense in which I can saythis is a tested American document.I am dwelling upon these points, my fellow citizens, in spite of thefact that I dare say to most of you they are perfectly well know, because in order to meetthe present situation we have go to know what we are dealing with. We are not dealing withthe kind of document which this is represented by some gentlemen to be; and inasmuch as weare dealing with a document simon-pure in respect of the very principles we have professedand lived up to, we have got to do one or other of two things -- we have go to adopt it orreject it. There is no middle course. You cannot go in on a special-privilege basis ofyour own. I take it that you are too proud to ask to be exempted fromresponsibilities which the other members of the League will carry. We go in upon equalterms or we do not go in at all; and if we do not go in, my fellow citizens, think of thetragedy of that result -- the only sufficient guaranty to the peace of the world withheld!Ourselves drawn apart with that dangerous pride which means that we shall be ready to takecare of ourselves, and that means that we shall maintain great standing armies and anirresistible envy; that means we shall have the organization of a military nation; thatmeans we shall have a general staff, with the kind of power that the general staff ofGermany had; to mobilize this great manhood of the Nation when it pleases, all the energyof our young men drawn into the thought and preparation for war. What of our pledges tothe men that lie dead in France? Wee said that they went over there not to prove theprowess of America or her readiness for another war but to see to tit hat there never wassuch a war again. It always seems to make it difficult for me to say anything my fellowcitizens, when I think of my clients in this case. My clients are the children; my clientsare the next generation. They do not know what promises and bonds I undertook when Iordered the armies of the United States to the soil of France, but I know, and I intend toredeem my pledges to the children; they shall not be sent upon a similar errand.Again and again, my fellow citizens, mothers who lost their sons inFrance have come to me and, taking my hand, have shed tears upon it not only, but theyadded, &#147;God bless you, Mr. President!&#148; Why, my fellow citizens, should they prayGod to bless me? I advised the Congress of the United States to create the situation thatled to the death of their sons. I ordered their sons overseas. I consented to their sonsbeing put in the most difficult parts of the battle line, where death was certain, as inthe impenetrable difficulties of the forest of Argonne. Why should they weep upon my handand call down the blessings of God upon me? Because they believe that their boys died forsomething that vastly transcends any of the immediate and palpable objects of the war.They believe, and they rightly believe, that their sons saved the liberty of the world.They believe that wrapped up with the liberty of the world is the continuous protection ofthat liberty by the concerted powers of all civilized people. They believe that thissacrifice was made in order that other sons should not be called upon for a similargift -- the gift of life, the gift of all that died -- and if we did not see this thingthrough, if we fulfilled the dearest present wish of Germany and now dissociated ourselvesfrom those alongside whom we fought in the world, would not something of the halo go awayfrom the gun over the mantelpiece, or the sword? Would not the old uniform lose somethingof its significance? These men were crusaders. They were not going forth to prove themight of the United States. They were going forth to prove the might of justice and right,and all the world accepted them as crusaders, and their transcendent achievement has madeall the world believe in America as it believes in no other nation organized in the modernworld. There seem to me to stand between us and the rejection or qualification of thistreaty the serried ranks of those boys in khaki, not only these boys who came home, butthose dear ghosts that still deploy upon the fields of France.My friends, on last Decoration day I went on a beautiful hillsidenear Paris, where was located the cemetery of Suresnes, a cemetery given over to theburial of the American dead. Behind me on the slopes was rank upon rank of living Americansoldiers, and lying before me upon the levels of the plain was rank upon rank of departedAmerican soldiers. Right by the side of the stand where I spoke there was a little groupof French women who had adopted those graves, had made themselves mothers of those dearghosts by putting flowers every day upon those graves, taking them as their own sons,their own beloved, because they had died in the same cause -- France was free and the worldwas free because America had come! I wish some men in public life who are now opposing thesettlement for which these men died could visit such a spot as that . I wish that thethought that comes out of those graves could penetrate their consciousness. I wish thatthey could feel the moral obligation that rests upon us not to go back on those boys, butto see the thing through, to see it through to the end and make good their redemption ofthe world. For nothing less depends upon this decision, nothing less than liberation andsalvation of the world.You will say, &#147;Is the League and absolute guaranty againstwar?&#148; No; I do not know any absolute guaranty against the errors of human judgment orthe violence of human passion, but I tell you this: With a cooling space of nine monthsfor human passion, not much of it will keep hot. I had a couple of friends who were in thehabit of losing their tempers, and when they lost their tempers they were in the habit ofusing very unparlimentary language.

NixonCambodian Incursion Address  delivered 30 April 1970 from Washington, (""soundPath"", ""rnixoncambodianincursion."");   ; for flash[  fromaudio. (2)]Good evening, my fellow Americans. Ten days ago, in my report to thenation on Vietnam, I announced the decision to withdraw an additional 150,000 Americans fromVietnam over the next year. I said then that I was making that decision despite ourconcern over increased enemy activity in Laos, in Cambodia, and in South Vietnam. And at that time I warned that if I concluded that increased enemyactivity in any of these areas endangered the lives of Americans remaining in Vietnam, Iwould not hesitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with that situation. Despite that warning, North Vietnam has increased its militaryaggression in all these areas, and particularly in Cambodia.After full consultation with the National Security Council,Ambassador Bunker, General Abrams and my other advisors, I have concluded that the actionsof the enemy in the last 10 days clearly endanger the lives of Americans who are inVietnam now and would constitute an unacceptable risk to those who will be there afterwithdrawal of another 150,000. To protect our men who are in Vietnam, and to guarantee thecontinued success of our withdrawal and Vietnamization program, I have concluded that thetime has come for action. Tonight, I shall describe the actions of the enemy, the actions Ihave ordered to deal with that situation, and the reasons for my decision.Cambodia -- a small country of seven million people -- has been aneutral nation since the Geneva Agreement of 1954, an agreement, incidentally, which wassigned by the government of North Vietnam. American policy since then has been to scrupulously respect theneutrality of the Cambodian people. We have maintained a skeleton diplomatic mission offewer than 15 in Cambodia&#146;s capital, and that only since last August. For the previous four years, from 1965 to 1969, we did not have anydiplomatic mission whatever in Cambodia, and for the past five years we have provided nomilitary assistance whatever and no economic assistance to Cambodia.North Vietnam, however, has not respected that neutrality. For thepast five years, as indicated on this map, that you see here, North Vietnam has occupiedmilitary sanctuaries all along the Cambodian frontier with South Vietnam. Some of theseextend up to 20 miles into Cambodia. The sanctuaries are in red, and as you note, they are on both sidesof the border. They are used for hit-and-run attacks on American and SouthVietnamese forces in South Vietnam. These Communist-occupied territories contain majorbase camps, training sites, logistics facilities, weapons and ammunition factories,airstrips, and prisoner of war compounds.And for five years neither the United States nor South Vietnam hasmoved against these enemy sanctuaries because we did not wish to violate the territory ofa neutral nation. Even after the Vietnamese Communists began to expand thesesanctuaries four weeks ago, we counseled patience to our South Vietnamese allies andimposed restraints on our own commanders.In contrast to our policy the enemy in the past two weeks hasstepped up his guerrilla actions, and he is concentrating his main forces in thesesanctuaries that you see in this map, where they are building up to launch massive attackson our forces and those of South Vietnam.North Vietnam in the last two weeks has stripped away all pretenseof respecting the sovereignty or the neutrality of Cambodia. Thousands of their soldiersare invading the country from the sanctuaries. They are encircling the capital of Pnompenh. Coming from these sanctuaries, as you see here, they had moved into Cambodia andare encircling the capital.Cambodia, as a result of this, has sent out a call to the UnitedStates, to a number of other nations, for assistance. Because if this enemy effortsucceeds, Cambodia would become a vast enemy staging area and a springboard for attacks onSouth Vietnam along 600 miles of frontier: a refuge where enemy troops could return fromcombat without fear of retaliation. North Vietnamese men and supplies could then be poured into thatcountry, jeopardizing not only the lives of our own men but the people of South Vietnam aswell. Now confronted with this situation we had three options: First, we can do nothing. Well the ultimate result of that course ofaction is clear. Unless we indulge in wishful thinking, the lives of Americans remainingin Vietnam after our next withdrawal of 150,000 would be gravely threatened.Let us go to the map again.Here is South Vietnam. Here is North Vietnam. North Vietnam alreadyoccupies this part of Laos. If North Vietnam also occupied this whole band in Cambodia, orthe entire country, it would mean that South Vietnam was completely outflanked and theforces of Americans in this area as well as the South Vietnamese would be in an untenablemilitary position.Our second choice is to provide massive military assistance toCambodia itself. Now unfortunately, while we deeply sympathize with the plight of sevenmillion Cambodians whose country has been invaded, massive amounts of military assistancecould not be rapidly and effectively utilized by this small Cambodian Army against theimmediate trap. With other nations we shall do our best to provide the small armsand other equipment which the Cambodian Army of 40,000 needs and can use for its defense. But the aid we will provide will be limited for the purpose ofenabling Cambodia to defend its neutrality and not for the purpose of making it an activebelligerent on one side or the other.Our third choice is to go to the heart of the trouble. And that means cleaning out major North Vietnamese and Vietcongoccupied territories, these sanctuaries which serve as bases for attacks on both Cambodiaand American and South Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam. Some of these, incidentally, are as close to Saigon as Baltimore isto Washington. This one, for example, is called the Parrot&#146;s Beak. It&#146;s only 33miles from Saigon.Now faced with these three options, this is the decision I havemade. In co-operation with the armed forces of South Vietnam, attacks are being launchedthis week to clean out major enemy sanctuaries on the Cambodian-Vietnam border. A majorresponsibility for the ground operations is being assumed by South Vietnamese forces.For example, the attacks in several areas, including theparrot&#146;s beak that I referred to a moment ago, are exclusively South Vietnameseground operations, under South Vietnamese command, with the United States providing airand logistical support. There is one area however, immediately above the parrot&#146;s beakwhere I have concluded that a combined American and South Vietnamese operation isnecessary.Tonight, American and South Vietnamese units will attack theheadquarters for the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam. This keycontrol center has been occupied by the North Vietnamese and Vietcong for five years inblatant violation of Cambodia&#146;s neutrality.This is not an invasion of Cambodia. The areas in which theseattacks will be launched are completely occupied and controlled by North Vietnameseforces. Our purpose is not to occupy the areas. Once enemy forces are drivenout of these sanctuaries, and once their military supplies are destroyed, we will withdraw.These actions are in no way directed to the security interests of anynation. Any government that chooses to use these actions as a pretext for harmingrelations with the United States will be doing so on its own responsibility and on its owninitiative, and we will draw the appropriate conclusions. And now, let me give you the reasons for my decision. A majority of the American people, a majority of you listening to meare for the withdrawal of our forces from Vietnam. The action I have taken tonight isindispensable for the continuing success of that withdrawal program. A majority of the American people want to end this war rather thanto have it drag on interminably. The action I have taken tonight will serve that purpose.A majority of the American people want to keep the casualties of our brave men in Vietnamat an absolute minimum. The action I take tonight is essential if we are to accomplish thatgoal. We take this action not for the purpose of expanding the war intoCambodia, but for the purpose of ending the war in Vietnam, and winning the just peace weall desire. We have made, we will continue to make every possible effort to endthis war through negotiation at the conference table rather than through more fighting inthe battlefield. Let&#146;s look again at the record.We stopped the bombing of North Vietnam. We have cut air operationsby over 20 per cent. We&#146;ve announced the withdrawal of over 250, 000 of our men.We&#146;ve offered to withdraw all of our men if they will withdraw theirs. We&#146;veoffered to negotiate all issues with only one condition: and that is that the future ofSouth Vietnam be determined, not by North Vietnam, and not by the United States, but bythe people of South Vietnam themselves.The answer of the enemy has been intransigence at the conferencetable, belligerence at Hanoi, massive military aggression in Laos and Cambodia andstepped-up attacks in South Vietnam designed to increase American casualties.This attitude has become intolerable.We will not react to this threat to American lives merely byplaintive, diplomatic protests.If we did, the credibility of the United States would be destroyed inevery area of the world where only the power of the United States deters aggression.Tonight, I again warn the North Vietnamese that if they continue toescalate the fighting when the United States is withdrawing its forces, I shall meet myresponsibility as commander in chief of our armed forces to take the action I considernecessary to defend the security of our American men.The action I have announced tonight puts the leaders of NorthVietnam on notice that we will be patient in working for peace. We will be conciliatory atthe conference table.But we will not be humiliated.We will not be defeated.We will not allow American men, by the thousands, to be killed by an enemy from privileged sanctuaries.The time came long ago to end this war through peacefulnegotiations. We stand ready for those negotiations. We&#146;ve made major efforts, many ofwhich must remain secret. I say tonight all the offers and approaches made previously remainon the conference table whenever Hanoi is ready to negotiate seriously. But if the enemy response to our most conciliatory offers forpeaceful negotiation continues to be to increase its attacks and humiliate and defeat us,we shall react accordingly. My fellow Americans, we live in an age of anarchy, both abroad andat home. We see mindless attacks on all the great institutions which have been created byfree civilizations in the last 500 years. Even here in the United States, greatuniversities are being systematically destroyed. Small nations all over the world find themselves under attack fromwithin and from without. If, when the chips are down, the world&#146;s most powerfulnation -- the United States of America -- acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces oftotalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions throughoutthe world. It is not our power, but our will and character that is being testedtonight. The question all Americans must ask and answer tonight is this: Does the richest and strongest nation in the history of the worldhave the character to meet a direct challenge by a group which rejects every effort to wina just peace, ignores our warning, tramples on solemn agreements, violates the neutralityof an unarmed people, and uses our prisoners as hostages? If we fail to meet this challenge,all other nations will be on notice that despite its overwhelming power the United Stateswhen a real crisis comes will be found wanting. During my campaign for the Presidency, I pledged to bring Americanshome form Vietnam. They are coming home. I promised to end this war. I shall keep thatpromise. I promised to win a just peace. I shall keep that promise. We shall avoid a widerwar, but we are also determined to put an end to this war. In this room, Woodrow Wilson made the great decisions which led tovictory in World War I. Franklin Roosevelt made the decisions which led to our victory inWorld War II. Dwight D. Eisenhower made decisions which ended the war in Korea and avoidedwar in the Middle East. John F. Kennedy, in his finest hour, made the great decision whichremoved Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba and the western hemisphere. I have noted that there&#146;s been a great deal of discussion withregard to this decision that I have made. And I should point out I do not contend that itis in the same magnitude as these decisions that I have just mentioned. But between thosedecisions and this decision, there is a difference that is very fundamental. In thosedecisions the American people were not assailed by counsels of doubt and defeat from someof the most widely known opinion leaders of the nation. I have noted, for example, that a Republican Senator has said thatthis action I have taken means that my party has lost all chance of winning the Novemberelections. And others are saying today that this move against enemy sanctuaries will makeme a one-term President.No one is more aware than I am of the political consequences of theaction I have taken. It is tempting to take the easy political path, to blame this waron previous Administrations, and to bring all of our men home immediately -- regardless ofthe consequences, even though that would mean defeat for the United States; to desert 18million South Vietnamese people who have put their trust in us; to expose them to the sameslaughter and savagery which the leaders of North Vietnam inflicted on hundreds ofthousands of North Vietnamese who chose freedom when the Communists took over NorthVietnam in 1954.To get peace at any price now, even though I know that a peace ofhumiliation for the United States would lead to a bigger war or surrender later. I have rejected all political considerations in making thisdecision. Whether my party gains in November is nothing compared to the lives of 400,000brave Americans fighting for our country and for the cause of peace and freedom inVietnam. Whether I may be a one-term President is insignificant compared towhether by our failure to act in this crisis the United States proves itself to beunworthy to lead the forces of freedom in this critical period in world history. I would rather be a one-term president and do what I believe wasright than to be a two-term President at the cost of seeing America become a second-ratepower and to see this nation accept the first defeat in its proud 190-year history. I realize in this war there are honest, deep differences in this country about whether we should have become involved; that there are differences to how the war should have been conducted. But the decision I announce tonight transcends those differences, for the lives of American men are involved.The opportunity for 150,000 Americans to come home in the next 12 months is involved.The future of 18-million people in South Vietnam and 7 million people in Cambodia is involved. The possibility of winning a just peace in Vietnam and in the Pacific is at stake.It is customary to conclude a speech from the White House by askingsupport for the President of the United States. Tonight, I depart from that precedent.What I ask is far more important. I ask for your support for our brave men fightingtonight halfway around the world, not for territory, not for glory, but so that theiryounger brothers and their sons and your sons can have a chance to grow up in a world ofpeace, and freedom, and justice.

",,,70," Carrie Chapman Catt - Address to Congress on Women's SuffrageCarrie Chapman CattAddress to the Congress on Women's Suffrage delivered November 1917, Washington D.C. for flashWoman suffrage is inevitable. Suffragists knew it before November 4, 1917; opponents afterward. Three distinct causes made it inevitable.First, the history of our country. Ours is a nation born of revolution, of rebellion against a system of government so securely entrenched in the customs and traditions of human society that in 1776 it seemed impregnable. From the beginning of things, nations had been ruled by kings and for kings, while the people served and paid the cost. The American Revolutionists boldly proclaimed the heresies: Taxation without representation is tyranny. Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. The colonists won, and the nation which was established as a result of their victory has held unfailingly that these two fundamental principles of democratic government are not only the spiritual source of our national existence but have been our chief historic pride and at all times the sheet anchor of our liberties.Eighty years after the Revolution, Abraham Lincoln welded those two maxims into a new one: Ours is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Fifty years more passed and the president of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, in a mighty crisis of the nation, proclaimed to the world: We are fighting for the things which we have always carried nearest to our hearts: for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government.All the way between these immortal aphorisms political leaders have declared unabated faith in their truth. Not one American has arisen to question their logic in the 141 years of our national existence. However stupidly our country may have evaded the logical application at times, it has never swerved from its devotion to the theory of democracy as expressed by those two axioms...With such a history behind it, how can our nation escape the logic it has never failed to follow, when its last un-enfranchised class calls for the vote? Behold our Uncle Sam floating the banner with one hand, Taxation without representation is tyranny, and with the other seizing the billions of dollars paid in taxes by women to whom he refuses representation. Behold him again, welcoming the boys of twenty-one and the newly made immigrant citizen to a voice in their own government while he denies that fundamental right of democracy to thousands of women public school teachers from whom many of these men learn all they know of citizenship and patriotism, to women college presidents, to women who preach in our pulpits, interpret law in our courts, preside over our hospitals, write books and magazines, and serve in every uplifting moral and social enterprise. Is there a single man who can justify such inequality of treatment, such outrageous discrimination? Not one...Second, the suffrage for women already established in the United States makes women suffrage for the nation inevitable. When Elihu Root, as president of the American Society of International Law, at the eleventh annual meeting in Washington, April 26, 1917, said, The world cannot be half democratic and half autocratic. It must be all democratic or all Prussian. There can be no compromise, he voiced a general truth. Precisely the same intuition has already taught the blindest and most hostile foe of woman suffrage that our nation cannot long continue a condition under which government in half its territory rests upon the consent of half of the people and in the other half upon the consent of all the people; a condition which grants representation to the taxed in half of its territory and denies it in the other half a condition which permits women in some states to share in the election of the president, senators, and representatives and denies them that privilege in others. It is too obvious to require demonstration that woman suffrage, now covering half our territory, will eventually be ordained in all the nation. No one will deny it. The only question left is when and how will it be completely established.Third, the leadership of the United States in world democracy compels the enfranchisement of its own women. The maxims of the Declaration were once called fundamental principles of government. They are now called American principles or even Americanisms. They have become the slogans of every movement toward political liberty the world around, of every effort to widen the suffrage for men or women in any land. Not a people, race, or class striving for freedom is there anywhere in the world that has not made our axioms the chief weapon of the struggle. More, all men and women the world around, with farsighted vision into the verities of things, know that the world tragedy of our day is not now being waged over the assassination of an archduke, nor commercial competition, nor national ambitions, nor the freedom of the seas. It is a death grapple between the forces which deny and those which uphold the truths of the Declaration of Independence...Do you realize that in no other country in the world with democratic tendencies is suffrage so completely denied as in a considerable number of our own states? There are thirteen black states where no suffrage for women exists, and fourteen others where suffrage for women is more limited than in many foreign countries.Do you realize that when you ask women to take their cause to state referendum you compel them to do this: that you drive women of education, refinement, achievement, to beg men who cannot read for their political freedom?Do you realize that such anomalies as a college president asking her janitor to give her a vote are overstraining the patience and driving women to desperation?Do you realize that women in increasing numbers indignantly resent the long delay in their enfranchisement?Your party platforms have pledged women suffrage. Then why not be honest, frank friends of our cause, adopt it in reality as your own, make it a party program, and fight with us? As a party measure -- a measure of all parties -- why not put the amendment through Congress and the legislatures? We shall all be better friends, we shall have a happier nation, we women will be free to support loyally the party of our choice, and we shall be far prouder of our history.There is one thing mightier than kings and armies -- aye, than Congresses and political parties -- the power of an idea when its time has come to move. The time for woman suffrage has come. The woman's hour has struck. If parties prefer to postpone action longer and thus do battle with this idea, they challenge the inevitable. The idea will not perish; the party which opposes it may. Every delay, every trick, every political dishonesty from now on will antagonize the women of the land more and more, and when the party or parties which have so delayed woman suffrage finally let it come, their sincerity will be doubted and their appeal to the new voters will be met with suspicion. This is the psychology of the situation. Can you afford the risk? Think it over.We know you will meet opposition. There are a few women haters left, a few old males of the tribe, as Vance Thompson calls them, whose duty they believe it to be to keep women in the places they have carefully picked out for them. Treitschke, made world famous by war literature, said some years ago, Germany, which knows all about Germany and France, knows far better what is good for Alsace-Lorraine than that miserable people can possibly know. A few American Treitschkes we have who know better than women what is good for them. There are women, too, with slave souls and clinging vines for backbones. There are female dolls and male dandies. But the world does not wait for such as these, nor does liberty pause to heed the plaint of men and women with a grouch. She does not wait for those who have a special interest to serve, nor a selfish reason for depriving other people of freedom. Holding her torch aloft, liberty is pointing the way onward and upward and saying to America, Come.To you and the supporters of our cause in Senate and House, and the number is large, the suffragists of the nation express their grateful thanks. This address is not meant for you. We are more truly appreciative of all you have done than any words can express. We ask you to make a last, hard fight for the amendment during the present session. Since last we asked a vote on this amendment, your position has been fortified by the addition to suffrage territory of Great Britain, Canada, and New York.Some of you have been too indifferent to give more than casual attention to this question. It is worthy of your immediate consideration. A question big enough to engage the attention of our allies in wartime is too big a question for you to neglect.Some of you have grown old in party service. Are you willing that those who take your places by and by shall blame you for having failed to keep pace with the world and thus having lost for them a party advantage? Is there any real gain for you, for your party, for your nation by delay? Do you want to drive the progressive men and women out of your party?Some of you hold to the doctrine of states' rights as applying to woman suffrage. Adherence to that theory will keep the United States far behind all other democratic nations upon this question. A theory which prevents a nation from keeping up with the trend of world progress cannot be justified.Gentlemen, we hereby petition you, our only designated representatives, to redress our grievances by the immediate passage of the Federal Suffrage Amendment and to use your influence to secure its ratification in your own state, in order that the women of our nation may be endowed with political freedom before the next presidential election, and that our nation may resume its world leadership in democracy.Woman suffrage is coming -- you know it.

Distinguished legislator, great spokeswoman for economic democracy and social justice in this country, I thank you for your eloquent introduction.Well, things worked out a little different from the way I thought, but let me tell you, I still love New York.My fellow Democrats and my fellow Americans, I have come here tonight not to argue as a candidate but to affirm a cause.I'm asking you -- I am asking you to renew the commitment of the Democratic Party to economic justice.I am asking you to renew our commitment to a fair and lasting prosperity that can put America back to work.This is the cause that brought me into the campaign and that sustained me for nine months across a 100,000 miles in 40 different states. We had our losses, but the pain of our defeats is far, far less than the pain of the people that I have met.We have learned that it is important to take issues seriously, but never to take ourselves too seriously.The serious issue before us tonight is the cause for which the Democratic Party has stood in its finest hours, the cause that keeps our Party young and makes it, in the second century of its age, the largest political Party in this republic and the longest lasting political Party on this planet.Our cause has been, since the days of Thomas Jefferson, the cause of the common man and the common woman.Our commitment has been, since the days of Andrew Jackson, to all those he called the humble members of society -- the farmers, mechanics, and laborers. On this foundation we have defined our values, refined our policies, and refreshed our faith.Now I take the unusual step of carrying the cause and the commitment of my campaign personally to our national convention. I speak out of a deep sense of urgency about the anguish and anxiety I have seen across America.I speak out of a deep belief in the ideals of the Democratic Party, and in the potential of that Party and of a President to make a difference. And I speak out of a deep trust in our capacity to proceed with boldness and a common vision that will feel and heal the suffering of our time and the divisions of our Party.The economic plank of this platform on its face concerns only material things, but it is also a moral issue that I raise tonight. It has taken many forms over many years. In this campaign and in this country that we seek to lead, the challenge in 1980 is to give our voice and our vote for these fundamental democratic principles.Let us pledge that we will never misuse unemployment, high interest rates, and human misery as false weapons against inflation.Let us pledge that employment will be the first priority of our economic policy.Let us pledge that there will be security for all those who are now at work, and let us pledge that there will be jobs for all who are out of work; and we will not compromise on the issues of jobs.These are not simplistic pledges. Simply put, they are the heart of our tradition, and they have been the soul of our Party across the generations. It is the glory and the greatness of our tradition to speak for those who have no voice, to remember those who are forgotten, to respond to the frustrations and fulfill the aspirations of all Americans seeking a better life in a better land.We dare not forsake that tradition.We cannot let the great purposes of the Democratic Party become the bygone passages of history.We must not permit the Republicans to seize and run on the slogans of prosperity. We heard the orators at their convention all trying to talk like Democrats. They proved that even Republican nominees can quote Franklin Roosevelt to their own purpose.The Grand Old Party thinks it has found a great new trick, but 40 years ago an earlier generation of Republicans attempted the same trick. And Franklin Roosevelt himself replied, Most Republican leaders have bitterly fought and blocked the forward surge of average men and women in their pursuit of happiness. Let us not be deluded that overnight those leaders have suddenly become the friends of average men and women.You know, he continued, very few of us are that gullible. And four years later when the Republicans tried that trick again, Franklin Roosevelt asked, Can the Old Guard pass itself off as the New Deal? I think not. We have all seen many marvelous stunts in the circus, but no performing elephant could turn a handspring without falling flat on its back.The 1980 Republican convention was awash with crocodile tears for our economic distress, but it is by their long record and not their recent words that you shall know them.The same Republicans who are talking about the crisis of unemployment have nominated a man who once said, and I quote, Unemployment insurance is a prepaid vacation plan for freeloaders. And that nominee is no friend of labor.The same Republicans who are talking about the problems of the inner cities have nominated a man who said, and I quote, I have included in my morning and evening prayers every day the prayer that the Federal Government not bail out New York. And that nominee is no friend of this city and our great urban centers across this nation.The same Republicans who are talking about security for the elderly have nominated a man who said just four years ago that Participation in social security should be made voluntary. And that nominee is no friend of the senior citizens of this nation.The same Republicans who are talking about preserving the environment have nominated a man who last year made the preposterous statement, and I quote, Eighty percent of our air pollution comes from plants and trees. And that nominee is no friend of the environment.And the same Republicans who are invoking Franklin Roosevelt have nominated a man who said in 1976, and these are his exact words, Fascism was really the basis of the New Deal. And that nominee whose name is Ronald Reagan has no right to quote Franklin Delano Roosevelt.The great adventures which our opponents offer is a voyage into the past. Progress is our heritage, not theirs. What is right for us as Democrats is also the right way for Democrats to win.The commitment I seek is not to outworn views but to old values that will never wear out. Programs may sometimes become obsolete, but the ideal of fairness always endures. Circumstances may change, but the work of compassion must continue. It is surely correct that we cannot solve problems by throwing money at them, but it is also correct that we dare not throw out our national problems onto a scrap heap of inattention and indifference. The poor may be out of political fashion, but they are not without human needs. The middle class may be angry, but they have not lost the dream that all Americans can advance together.The demand of our people in 1980 is not for smaller government or bigger government but for better government. Some say that government is always bad and that spending for basic social programs is the root of our economic evils. But we reply: The present inflation and recession cost our economy 200 billion dollars a year. We reply: Inflation and unemployment are the biggest spenders of all.The task of leadership in 1980 is not to parade scapegoats or to seek refuge in reaction, but to match our power to the possibilities of progress. While others talked of free enterprise, it was the Democratic Party that acted and we ended excessive regulation in the airline and trucking industry, and we restored competition to the marketplace. And I take some satisfaction that this deregulation legislation that I sponsored and passed in the Congress of the United States.As Democrats we recognize that each generation of Americans has a rendezvous with a different reality. The answers of one generation become the questions of the next generation. But there is a guiding star in the American firmament. It is as old as the revolutionary belief that all people are created equal, and as clear as the contemporary condition of Liberty City and the South Bronx. Again and again Democratic leaders have followed that star and they have given new meaning to the old values of liberty and justice for all.We are the Party -- We are the Party of the New Freedom, the New Deal, and the New Frontier. We have always been the Party of hope. So this year let us offer new hope, new hope to an America uncertain about the present, but unsurpassed in its potential for the future.To all those who are idle in the cities and industries of America let us provide new hope for the dignity of useful work. Democrats have always believed that a basic civil right of all Americans is that their right to earn their own way. The Party of the people must always be the Party of full employment.To all those who doubt the future of our economy, let us provide new hope for the reindustrialization of America. And let our vision reach beyond the next election or the next year to a new generation of prosperity. If we could rebuild Germany and Japan after World War II, then surely we can reindustrialize our own nation and revive our inner cities in the 1980's.To all those who work hard for a living wage let us provide new hope that their price of their employment shall not be an unsafe workplace and a death at an earlier age.To all those who inhabit our land from California to the New York Island, from the Redwood Forest to the Gulf stream waters, let us provide new hope that prosperity shall not be purchased by poisoning the air, the rivers, and the natural resources that are the greatest gift of this continent. We must insist that our children and our grandchildren shall inherit a land which they can truly call America the beautiful.To all those who see the worth of their work and their savings taken by inflation, let us offer new hope for a stable economy. We must meet the pressures of the present by invoking the full power of government to master increasing prices. In candor, we must say that the Federal budget can be balanced only by policies that bring us to a balanced prosperity of full employment and price restraint.And to all those overburdened by an unfair tax structure, let us provide new hope for real tax reform. Instead of shutting down classrooms, let us shut off tax shelters. Instead of cutting out school lunches, let us cut off tax subsidies for expensive business lunches that are nothing more than food stamps for the rich.The tax cut of our Republican opponents takes the name of tax reform in vain. It is a wonderfully Republican idea that would redistribute income in the wrong direction. It's good news for any of you with incomes over 200,000 dollars a year. For the few of you, it offers a pot of gold worth 14,000 dollars. But the Republican tax cut is bad news for the middle income families. For the many of you, they plan a pittance of 200 dollars a year, and that is not what the Democratic Party means when we say tax reform.The vast majority of Americans cannot afford this panacea from a Republican nominee who has denounced the progressive income tax as the invention of Karl Marx. I am afraid he has confused Karl Marx with Theodore Roosevelt -- that obscure Republican president who sought and fought for a tax system based on ability to pay. Theodore Roosevelt was not Karl Marx, and the Republican tax scheme is not tax reform.Finally, we cannot have a fair prosperity in isolation from a fair society. So I will continue to stand for a national health insurance. We must -- We must not surrender -- We must not surrender to the relentless medical inflation that can bankrupt almost anyone and that may soon break the budgets of government at every level. Let us insist on real controls over what doctors and hospitals can charge, and let us resolve that the state of a family's health shall never depend on the size of a family's wealth.The President, the Vice President, the members of Congress have a medical plan that meets their needs in full, and whenever senators and representatives catch a little cold, the Capitol physician will see them immediately, treat them promptly, fill a prescription on the spot. We do not get a bill even if we ask for it, and when do you think was the last time a member of Congress asked for a bill from the Federal Government? And I say again, as I have before, if health insurance is good enough for the President, the Vice President, the Congress of the United States, then it's good enough for you and every family in America.There were some -- There were some who said we should be silent about our differences on issues during this convention, but the heritage of the Democratic Party has been a history of democracy. We fight hard because we care deeply about our principles and purposes. We did not flee this struggle. We welcome the contrast with the empty and expedient spectacle last month in Detroit where no nomination was contested, no question was debated, and no one dared to raise any doubt or dissent.Democrats can be proud that we chose a different course and a different platform. We can be proud that our Party stands for investment in safe energy, instead of a nuclear future that may threaten the future itself. We must not permit the neighborhoods of America to be permanently shadowed by the fear of another Three Mile Island.We can be proud that our Party stands for a fair housing law to unlock the doors of discrimination once and for all. The American house will be divided against itself so long as there is prejudice against any American buying or renting a home.And we can be proud that our Party stands plainly and publicly and persistently for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.Women hold their rightful place at our convention, and women must have their rightful place in the Constitution of the United States. On this issue we will not yield; we will not equivocate; we will not rationalize, explain, or excuse. We will stand for E.R.A. and for the recognition at long last that our nation was made up of founding mothers as well as founding fathers.A fair prosperity and a just society are within our vision and our grasp, and we do not have every answer. There are questions not yet asked, waiting for us in the recesses of the future. But of this much we can be certain because it is the lesson of all of our history: Together a President and the people can make a difference. I have found that faith still alive wherever I have traveled across this land. So let us reject the counsel of retreat and the call to reaction. Let us go forward in the knowledge that history only helps those who help themselves.There will be setbacks and sacrifices in the years ahead; but I am convinced that we as a people are ready to give something back to our country in return for all it has given to us.Let this -- Let this be our commitment: Whatever sacrifices must be made will be shared and shared fairly. And let this be our confidence: At the end of our journey and always before us shines that ideal of liberty and justice for all.In closing, let me say a few words to all those that I have met and to all those who have supported me at this convention and across the country. There were hard hours on our journey, and often we sailed against the wind. But always we kept our rudder true, and there were so many of you who stayed the course and shared our hope. You gave your help; but even more, you gave your hearts.And because of you, this has been a happy campaign. You welcomed Joan, me, and our family into your homes and neighborhoods, your churches, your campuses, your union halls. And when I think back of all the miles and all the months and all the memories, I think of you. And I recall the poet's words, and I say: What golden friends I had.Among you, my golden friends across this land, I have listened and learned.I have listened to Kenny Dubois, a glassblower in Charleston, West Virginia, who has ten children to support but has lost his job after 35 years, just three years short of qualifying for his pension.I have listened to the Trachta family who farm in Iowa and who wonder whether they can pass the good life and the good earth on to their children.I have listened to the grandmother in East Oakland who no longer has a phone to call her grandchildren because she gave it up to pay the rent on her small apartment.I have listened to young workers out of work, to students without the tuition for college, and to families without the chance to own a home. I have seen the closed factories and the stalled assembly lines of Anderson, Indiana and South Gate, California, and I have seen too many, far too many idle men and women desperate to work. I have seen too many, far too many working families desperate to protect the value of their wages from the ravages of inflation.Yet I have also sensed a yearning for a new hope among the people in every state where I have been.And I have felt it in their handshakes, I saw it in their faces, and I shall never forget the mothers who carried children to our rallies.I shall always remember the elderly who have lived in an America of high purpose and who believe that it can all happen again.Tonight, in their name, I have come here to speak for them. And for their sake, I ask you to stand with them. On their behalf I ask you to restate and reaffirm the timeless truth of our Party.I congratulate President Carter on his victory here.I am -- I am confident that the Democratic Party will reunite on the basis of Democratic principles, and that together we will march towards a Democratic victory in 1980.And someday, long after this convention, long after the signs come down and the crowds stop cheering, and the bands stop playing, may it be said of our campaign that we kept the faith.May it be said of our Party in 1980 that we found our faith again.And may it be said of us, both in dark passages and in bright days, in the words of Tennyson that my brothers quoted and loved, and that have special meaning for me now:I am a part of all that I have metTo [Tho] much is taken, much abidesThat which we are, we are --One equal temper of heroic heartsStrong in willTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.For me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end.For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.

",,,72," Lyndon Baines Johnson -- On Vietnam and Not Seeking ReelectionLyndon Baines JohnsonOn Vietnam and Not Seeking Reelection delivered 31 March 1968Video Purchase  );  "", ""lbjvietnamandreelection1122."");   ; for flash[  fromaudio.]Good evening, my fellow Americans:Tonight I want to speak to you of peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. No other question so preoccupies our people. No other dream so absorbs the 250 million human beings who live in that part of the world. No other goal motivates American policy in Southeast Asia.For years, representatives of our Governments and others have traveled the world seeking to find a basis for peace talks. Since last September they have carried the offer that I made public at San Antonio. And that offer was this:That theUnited States would stop its bombardment of North Vietnam when that would lead promptly to productive discussions -- and that we would assume that North Vietnam would not take military advantage of our restraint.Hanoi denounced this offer, both privately and publicly. Even while the search for peace was going on, North Vietnam rushed their preparations for a savage assault on the people, the government, and the allies of South Vietnam. Their attack -- during the Tet holidays -- failed to achieve its principal objectives. It did not collapse the elected Government of South Vietnam or shatter its army -- as the Communists had hoped. It did not produce a general uprising among the people of the cities, as they had predicted. The Communists were unable to maintain control of any of the more than 30 cities that they attacked. And they took very heavy casualties. But they did compel the South Vietnamese and their allies to move certain forces from the countryside into the cities. They caused widespread disruption and suffering. Their attacks, and the battles that followed, made refugees of half a million human beings.The Communists may renew their attack any day. They are, it appears, trying to make 1968 the year of decision in South Vietnam -- the year that brings, if not final victory or defeat, at least a turning point in the struggle.This much is clear: If they do mount another round of heavy attacks, they will not succeed in destroying the fighting power of South Vietnam and its allies. But tragically, this is also clear: Many men -- on both sides of the struggle -- will be lost. A nation that has already suffered 20 years of warfare will suffer once again. Armies on both sides will take new casualties. And the war will go on. There is no need for this to be so. There is no need to delay the talks that could bring an end to this long and this bloody war.Tonight, I renew the offer I made last August: to stop the bombardment of North Vietnam. We ask that talks begin promptly, that they be serious talks on the substance of peace. We assume that during those talks Hanoi will not take advantage of our restraint. We are prepared to move immediately toward peace through negotiations. So tonight, in the hope that this action will lead to early talks, I am taking the first step to de-escalate the conflict. We are reducing -- substantially reducing -- the present level of hostilities, and we are doing so unilaterally and at once.Tonight, I have ordered our aircraft and our naval vessels to make no attacks on North Vietnam, except in the area north of the demilitarized zone where the continuing enemy buildup directly threatens allied forward positions and where the movements of their troops and supplies are clearly related to that threat. The area in which we are stopping our attacks includes almost 90 percent of North Vietnam's population, and most of its territory. Thus, there will be no attacks around the principal populated areas, or in the food-producing areas of North Vietnam.Even this very limited bombing of the North could come to an early end -- if our restraint is matched by restraint in Hanoi. But I cannot in good conscience stop all bombing so long as to do so would immediately and directly endanger the lives of our men and our allies. Whether a complete bombing halt becomes possible in the future will be determined by events. Our purpose in this action is to bring about a reduction in the level of violence that now exists. It is to save the lives of brave men --and to save the lives of innocent women and children. It is to permit the contending forces to move closer to a political settlement. And tonight I call upon the United Kingdom and I call upon the Soviet Union -- as co-chairmen of the Geneva conferences, and as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- to do all they can to move from the unilateral act of de-escalation that I have just announced toward genuine peace in Southeast Asia.Now, as in the past, the United States is ready to send its representatives to any forum, at any time, to discuss the means of bringing this ugly war to an end. I am designating one of our most distinguished Americans, Ambassador Averell Harriman, as my personal representative for such talks. In addition, I have asked Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson, who returned from Moscow for consultation, to be available to join Ambassador Harriman at Geneva or any other suitable place -- just as soon as Hanoi agrees to a conference.I call upon President Ho Chi Minh to respond positively, and favorably, to this new step toward peace. But if peace does not come now through negotiations, it will come when Hanoi understands that our common resolve is unshakable, and our common strength is invincible.Tonight, we and the other allied nations are contributing 600,000 fighting men to assist 700,000 South Vietnamese troops in defending their little country. Our presence there has always rested on this basic belief: The main burden of preserving their freedom must be carried out by them -- by the South Vietnamese themselves.We and our allies can only help to provide a shield behind which the people of South Vietnam can survive and can grow and develop. On their efforts -- on their determinations and resourcefulness --the outcome will ultimately depend. That small, beleaguered nation has suffered terrible punishment for more than 20 years. I pay tribute once again tonight to the great courage and the endurance of its people. South Vietnam supports armed forces tonight of almost 700,000 men, and I call your attention to the fact that that is the equivalent of more than 10 million in our own population. Its people maintain their firm determination to be free of domination by the North.There has been substantial progress, I think, in building a durable government during these last three years. The South Vietnam of 1965 could not have survived the enemy's Tet offensive of 1968. The elected government of South Vietnam survived that attack -- and is rapidly repairing the devastation that it wrought. The South Vietnamese know that further efforts are going to be required to expand their own armed forces; to move back into the countryside as quickly as possible; to increase their taxes; to select the very best men that they have for civil and military responsibilities; to achieve a new unity within their constitutional government, and to include in the national effort all those groups who wish to preserve South Vietnam's control over its own destiny.Last week President Thieu ordered the mobilization of 135,000 additional South Vietnamese. He plans to reach as soon as possible a total military strength of more than 800,000 men. To achieve this, the Government of South Vietnam started the drafting of 19-year-olds on March 1st. On May 1st, the Government will begin the drafting of 18-year-olds. Last month, 10,000 men volunteered for military service. That was two and a half times the number of volunteers during the same month last year. Since the middle of January, more than 48,000 South Vietnamese have joined the armed forces, and nearly half of them volunteered to do so.All men in the South Vietnamese armed forces have had their tours of duty extended for the duration of the war, and reserves are now being called up for immediate active duty. President Thieu told his people last week, and I quote:We must make greater efforts, we must accept more sacrifices, because as I have said many times, this is our country. The existence of our nation is at stake, and this is mainly a Vietnamese responsibility.He warned his people that a major national effort is required to root out corruption and incompetence at all levels of government. We applaud this evidence of determination on the part of South Vietnam. Our first priority will be to support their effort. We shall accelerate the re-equipment of South Vietnam's armed forces in order to meet the enemy's increased firepower. And this will enable them progressively to undertake a larger share of combat operations against the Communist invaders.On many occasions I have told the American people that we would send to Vietnam those forces that are required to accomplish our mission there. So with that as our guide we have previously authorized a force level of approximately 525,000. Some weeks ago to help meet the enemy's new offensive we sent to Vietnam about 11,000 additional Marine and airborne troops. They were deployed by air in 48 hours on an emergency basis. But the artillery and the tank and the aircraft and medical and other units that were needed to work with and support these infantry troops in combat could not then accompany them by air on that short notice.In order that these forces may reach maximum combat effectiveness, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have recommended to me that we should prepare to send during the next five months the support troops totaling approximately 13,500 men. A portion of these men will be made available from our active forces. The balance will come from reserve component units, which will be called up for service.The actions that we have taken since the beginning of the year to re-equip the South Vietnamese forces; to meet our responsibilities in Korea, as well as our responsibilities in Vietnam; to meet price increases and the cost of activating and deploying these reserve forces; to replace helicopters and provide the other military supplies we need, all of these actions are going to require additional expenditures. The tentative estimate of those additional expenditures is 2 1/2 billion dollars in this fiscal year and  2 billion, 600 million in the next fiscal year. These projected increases in expenditures for our national security will bring into sharper focus the nation's need for immediate action, action to protect the prosperity of the American people and to protect the strength and the stability of our American dollar.On many occasions I have pointed out that without a tax bill or decreased expenditures, next year's deficit would again be around $20 billion. I have emphasized the need to set strict priorities in our spending. I have stressed that failure to act -- and to act promptly and decisively -- would raise very strong doubts throughout the world about America's willingness to keep its financial house in order.Yet Congress has not acted. And tonight we face the sharpest financial threat in the postwar era -- a threat to the dollar's role as the keystone of international trade and finance in the world.Last week, at the monetary conference in Stockholm, the major industrial countries decided to take a big step toward creating a new international monetary asset that will strengthen the international monetary system. And I'm very proud of the very able work done by Secretary Fowler and Chairman Martin of the Federal Reserve Board. But to make this system work, the United States just must bring its balance of payments to -- or very close to -- equilibrium. We must have a responsible fiscal policy in this country. The passage of a tax bill now, together with expenditure control that the Congress may desire and dictate, is absolutely necessary to protect this nationåÕs security, and to continue our prosperity, and to meet the needs of our people.Now, what is at stake is seven years of unparalleled prosperity. In those seven years, the real income of the average American, after taxes, rose by almost 30 percent -- a gain as large as that of the entire preceding 19 years. So the steps that we must take to convince the world are exactly the steps that we must take to sustain our own economic strength here at home. In the past eight months, prices and interest rates have risen because of our inaction. We must therefore now do everything we can to move from debate to action, from talking to voting and there is, I believe -- I hope there is -- in both Houses of the Congress a growing sense of urgency that this situation just must be acted upon and must be corrected.My budget in January, we thought, was a tight one. It fully reflected our evaluation of most of the demanding needs of this nation. But in these budgetary matters, the President does not decide alone. The Congress has the power, and the duty, to determine appropriations and taxes. And the Congress is now considering our proposals, and they are considering reductions in the budget that we submitted.As part of a program of fiscal restraint that includes the tax surcharge, I shall approve appropriate reductions in the January budget when and if Congress so decides that that should be done. One thing is unmistakably clear, however. Our deficit just must be reduced. Failure to act could bring on conditions that would strike hardest at those people that all of us are trying so hard to help So these times call for prudence in this land of plenty. And I believe that we have the character to provide it, and tonight I plead with the Congress and with the people to act promptly to serve the national interest and thereby serve all of our people.Now let me give you my estimate of the chances for peace -- the peace that will one day stop the bloodshed in South Vietnam; that will -- all the Vietnamese people [will] be permitted to rebuild and develop their land; that will permit us to turn more fully to our own tasks here at home. I cannot promise that the initiative that I have announced tonight will be completely successful in achieving peace any more than the 30 others that we have undertaken and agreed to in recent years. But it is our fervent hope that North Vietnam, after years of fighting that has left the issue unresolved, will now cease its efforts to achieve a military victory and will join with us in moving toward the peace table.And there may come a time when South Vietnamese -- on both sides -- are able to work out a way to settle their own differences by free political choice rather than by war. As Hanoi considers its course, it should be in no doubt of our intentions. It must not miscalculate the pressures within our democracy in this election year. We have no intention of widening this war. But the United States will never accept a fake solution to this long and arduous struggle and call it peace. No one can foretell the precise terms of an eventual settlement. Our objective in South Vietnam has never been the annihilation of the enemy. It has been to bring about a recognition in Hanoi that its objective -- taking over the South by force -- could not be achieved. We think that peace can be based on the Geneva Accords of 1954, under political conditions that permit the South Vietnamese -- all the South Vietnamese -- to chart their course free of any outside domination or interference, from us or from anyone else.So tonight, I reaffirm the pledge that we made at Manila: that we are prepared to withdraw our forces from South Vietnam as the other side withdraws its forces to the North, stops the infiltration, and the level of violence thus subsides. Our goal of peace and self-determination in Vietnam is directly related to the future of all of Southeast Asia, where much has happened to inspire confidence during the past 10 years. And we have done all that we knew how to do to contribute and to help build that confidence.A number of its nations have shown what can be accomplished under conditions of security. Since 1966, Indonesia, the fifth largest nation in all the world, with a population of more than 100 million people, has had a government thatåÕs dedicated to peace with its neighbors and improved conditions for its own people.Political and economic cooperation between nations has grown rapidly. And I think every American can take a great deal of pride in the role that we have played in bringing this about in Southeast Asia. We can rightly judge -- as responsible Southeast Asians themselves do -- that the progress of the past three years would have been far less likely, if not completely impossible, if America's sons and others had not made their stand in Vietnam.At Johns Hopkins University about three years ago, I announced that the United States would take part in the great work of developing Southeast Asia, including the Mekong valley, for all the people of that region. Our determination to help build a better land -- a better land for men on both sides of the present conflict -- has not diminished in the least. Indeed, the ravages of war, I think, have made it more urgent than ever.So I repeat on behalf of the United States again tonight what I said at Johns Hopkins -- that North Vietnam could take its place in this common effort just as soon as peace comes. Over time, a wider framework of peace and security in Southeast Asia may become possible. The new cooperations of the nations of the area could be a foundation stone. Certainly friendship with the nations of such a Southeast Asia is what the United States seeks -- and that is all that the United States seeks.One day, my fellow citizen, there will be peace in Southeast Asia. It will come because the people of Southeast Asia want it -- those whose armies are at war tonight; those who, though threatened, have thus far been spared. Peace will come because Asians were willing to work for it and to sacrifice for it -- and to die by the thousands for it. But let it never be forgotten: peace will come also because America sent her sons to help secure it.It has not been easy -- far from it. During the past four and a half years, it has been my fate and my responsibility to be Commander in Chief. I have lived daily and nightly with the cost of this war. I know the pain that it has inflicted. I know perhaps better than anyone the misgivings that it has aroused. And throughout this entire long period I have been sustained by a single principle: that what we are doing now in Vietnam is vital not only to the security of Southeast Asia, but it is vital to the security of every American.Surely, we have treaties which we must respect. Surely, we have commitments that we are going to keep. Resolutions of the Congress testify to the need to resist aggression in the world and in Southeast Asia.But the heart of our involvement in South Vietnam under three different presidents, three separate Administrations, has always been America's own security. And the larger purpose of our involvement has always been to help the nations of Southeast Asia become independent, and stand alone, self-sustaining as members of a great world community, at peace with themselves, at peace with all others. And with such a nation our country -- and the world -- will be far more secure than it is tonight.I believe that a peaceful Asia is far nearer to reality because of what America has done in Vietnam. I believe that the men who endure the dangers of battle there, fighting there for us tonight, are helping the entire world avoid far greater conflicts, far wider wars, far more destruction, than this one. The peace that will bring them home someday will come. Tonight, I have offered the first in what I hope will be a series of mutual moves toward peace.I pray that it will not be rejected by the leaders of North Vietnam. I pray that they will accept it as a means by which the sacrifices of their own people may be ended. And I ask your help and your support, my fellow citizens, for this effort to reach across the battlefield toward an early peace.Finally, my fellow Americans, let me say this: Of those to whom much is given, much is asked. I cannot say -- and no man could say -- that no more will be asked of us. Yet I believe that now, no less than when the decade began, this generation of Americans is willing to pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival, and the success, of liberty.å_Since those words were spoken by John F. Kennedy, the people of America have kept that compact with mankind's noblest cause. And we shall continue to keep it.Yet, I believe that we must always be mindful of this one thing -- whatever the trials and the tests ahead, the ultimate strength of our country and our cause will lie, not in powerful weapons or infinite resources or boundless wealth, but will lie in the unity of our people.This I believe very deeply. Throughout my entire public career I have followed the personal philosophy that I am a free man, an American, a public servant, and a member of my party -- in that order -- always and only.For 37 years in the service of our nation, first as a Congressman, as a Senator, and as Vice President, and now as your President, I have put the unity of the people first. I have put it ahead of any divisive partisanship. And in these times as in times before, it is true that a house divided against itself by the spirit of faction, of party, of region, of religion, of race, is a house that cannot stand.There is division in the American house now. There is divisiveness among us all tonight. And holding the trust that is mine, as President of all the people, I cannot disregard the peril to the progress of the American people and the hope and the prospects of peace for all peoples. So, I would ask all Americans, whatever their personal interests or concern, to guard against divisiveness and all of its ugly consequences.Fifty-two months and ten days ago, in a moment of tragedy and trauma, the duties of this office fell upon me. I asked then for your help and God's, that we might continue America on its course, binding up our wounds, healing our history, moving forward in new unity to clear the American agenda and to keep the American commitment for all of our people.United we have kept that commitment. And united we have enlarged that commitment. And through all time to come I think America will be a stronger nation, a more just society, a land of greater opportunity and fulfillment because of what we have all done together in these years of unparalleled achievement.Our reward will come in the life of freedom and peace and hope that our children will enjoy through ages ahead. What we won when all of our people united just must not now be lost in suspicion and distrust and selfishness and politics among any of our people. And believing this, as I do, I have concluded that I should not permit the Presidency to become involved in the partisan divisions that are developing in this political year.With American sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office -- the Presidency of your country.Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President. But let men everywhere know, however, that a strong and a confident and a vigilant America stands ready tonight to seek an honorable peace; and stands ready tonight to defend an honored cause, whatever the price, whatever the burden, whatever the sacrifice that duty may require.Thank you for listening.

",,,73,"Franklin Delano Roosevelt - Commonwealth Club AddressFranklin Delano RooseveltCommonwealth Club Address delivered 23 Sept 1932, San Francisco, CA for flashMy friends:I count it a privilege to be invited to address the CommonwealthClub. It has stood in the life of this city and state, and it is perhaps accurate to add,the nation, as a group of citizen leaders interested in fundamental problems ofgovernment, and chiefly concerned with achievement of progress in government throughnon-partisan means. The privilege of addressing you, therefore, in the heat of a politicalcampaign, is great. I want to respond to your courtesy in terms consistent with yourpolicy.I want to speak not of politics but of government. I want to speaknot of parties, but of universal principles. They are not political, except in that largersense in which a great American once expressed a definition of politics, that nothing inall of human life is foreign to the science of politics...The issue of government has always been whether individual men andwomen will have to serve some system of government of economics, or whether a system ofgovernment and economics exists to serve individual men and women. This question haspersistently dominated the discussion of government for many generations. On questionsrelating to these things men have differed, and for time immemorial it is probable thathonest men will continue to differ.The final word belongs to no man; yet we can still believe in changeand in progress. Democracy, as a dear old friend of mine in Indian, Meredith Nicholson,has called it, is a quest, a never-ending seeking for better things, and in the seekingfor these things and the striving for better things, and in the seeking for these thingsand the striving for them, there are many roads to follow. But, if we map the course ofthese roads, we find that there are only two general directions.When we look about us, we are likely to forget how hard people haveworked to win the privilege of government. The growth of the national governments ofEurope was a struggle for the development of a centralized force in the nation, strongenough to impose peace upon ruling barons. In many instances the victory of the centralgovernment, the creation of a strong central government, was a haven of refuge to theindividual. The people preferred the master far away to the exploitation and cruelty ofthe smaller master near at hand.But the creators of national government were perforce ruthless men.They were often cruel in their methods, but they did strive steadily toward something thatsociety needed and very much wanted, a strong central state, able to keep the peace, tostamp out civil war, to put the unruly nobleman in his place, and to permit the bulk ofindividuals to live safely. The man of ruthless force had his place in developing apioneer country, just as he did in fixing the power of the central government in thedevelopment of nations. Society paid him well for his services and its development. Whenthe development among the nations of Europe, however, has been completed, ambition, andruthlessness, having served its term tended to overstep its mark.There came a growing feeling that government was conducted for thebenefit of a few who thrived unduly at the expense of all. The people sought a balancing-a limiting force. There came gradually, through town councils, trade guilds, nationalparliaments, by constitution and by popular participation and control, limitations onarbitrary power.Another factor that tended to limit the power of those who ruled,was the rise of the ethical conception that a ruler bore a responsibility for the welfareof his subjects.The American colonies were born in this struggle. The AmericanRevolution was a turning point in it. After the revolution the struggle continued andshaped itself in the public life of the country. There were those who because they hadseen the confusion which attended the years of war for American independence surrenderedto the belief that popular government was essentially dangerous and essentiallyunworkable. They were honest people, my friends, and we cannot deny that their experiencehad warranted some measure of fear. The most brilliant, honest and able exponent of thispoint of view was Hamilton. He was too impatient of slow moving methods. Fundamentally hebelieved that the safety of the republic lay in the autocratic strength of its government,that the destiny of individuals was to serve that government, and that fundamentally agreat and strong group of central institutions, guided by a small group of able and publicspirited citizens could best direct all government.But Mr. Jefferson, in the summer of 1776, after drafting theDeclaration of Independence turned his mind to the same problem and took a different view.He did not deceive himself with outward forms. Government to him was a means to an end,not an end in itself; it might be either a refuge and a help or a threat and a danger,depending on the circumstances. We find him carefully analyzing the society for which hewas to organize a government. &#147;We have no paupers. The great mass of our populationis of laborers, our rich who cannot live without labor, either manual or professional,being few and of moderate wealth. Most of the laboring class possess property, cultivatetheir own lands, have families and from the demand for their labor, are enabled to exactfrom the rich and the competent such prices as enable them to feed abundantly, clotheabove mere decency, to labor moderately and raise their families.&#148;These people, he considered, had two sets of rights, those of&#147;personal competency&#148; and those involved in acquiring and possessing property.By &#147;personal competency&#148; he meant the right of free thinking, freedom of formingand expressing opinions, and freedom of personal living each man according to his ownlights. To insure the first set of rights, a government must so order its functions as notto interfere with the individual. But even Jefferson realized that the exercise of theproperty rights might so interfere with the rights of the individual that the government,without whose assistance the property rights could not exist, must intervene, not todestroy individualism but to protect it.You are familiar with the great political duel which followed, andhow Hamilton, and his friends, building towards a dominant centralized power were atlength defeated in the great election of 1800, by Mr. Jefferson&#146;s party. Out of thatduel came the two parties, Republican and Democratic, as we know them today.So began, in American political life, the new day, the day of theindividual against the system, the day in which individualism was made the great watchwordof American life. The happiest of economic conditions made that day long and splendid. Onthe Western frontier, land was substantially free. No one, who did not shirk the task ofearning a living, was entirely without opportunity to do so. Depressions could, and did,come and go; but they could not alter the fundamental fact that most of the people livedpartly by selling their labor and partly by extracting their livelihood from the soil, sothat starvation and dislocation were practically impossible. At the very worst there wasalways the possibility of climbing into a covered wagon and moving west where the untilledprairies afforded a haven for men to whom the East did not provide a place. So great wereour natural resources that we could offer this relief not only to our own people, but tothe distressed of all the world; we could invite immigration from Europe, and welcome itwith open arms. Traditionally, when a depression came, a new section of land was opened inthe West; and even our temporary misfortune served our manifest destiny.It was the middle of the 19th century that a new force was releasedand a new dream created. The force was what is called the industrial revolution, theadvance of steam and machinery and the rise of the forerunners of the modern industrialplant. The dream was the dream of an economic machine, able to raise the standard ofliving for everyone; to bring luxury within the reach of the humblest; to annihilatedistance by steam power and later by electricity, and to release everyone from thedrudgery of the heaviest manual toil. It was to be expected that this would necessarilyaffect government. Heretofore, government had merely been called upon to produceconditions within which people could live happily, labor peacefully, and rest secure. Nowit was called upon to aid in the consummation of this new dream. There was, however, ashadow over the dream. To be made real, it required use of the talents of men oftremendous will, and tremendous ambition, since by no other force could the problems offinancing and engineering and new developments be brought to a consummation.So manifest were the advantages of the machine age, however, thatthe United States fearlessly, cheerfully, and, I think, rightly, accepted the bitter withthe sweet. It was thought that no price was too high to pay for the advantages which wecould draw from a finished industrial system. The history of the last half century isaccordingly in large measure a history of a group of financial Titans, whose methods werenot scrutinized with too much care, and who were honored in proportion as they producedthe results, irrespective of the means they used. The financiers who pushed the railroadsto the Pacific were always ruthless, we have them today. It has been estimated that theAmerican investor paid for the American railway system more than three times over in theprocess; but despite that fact the net advantage was to the United States. As long as wehad free land; as long as population was growing by leaps and bounds; as long as ourindustrial plants were insufficient to supply our needs, society chose to give theambitious man free play and unlimited reward provided only that he produced the economicplant so much desired.During this period of expansion, there was equal opportunity for alland the business of government was not to interfere but to assist in the development ofindustry. This was done at the request of businessmen themselves. The tariff wasoriginally imposed for the purpose of &#147;fostering our infant industry&#148;, a phraseI think the older among you will remember as a political issue not so long ago. Therailroads were subsidized, sometimes by grants of money, oftener by grants of land; someof the most valuable oil lands in the United States were granted to assist the financingof the railroad which pushed through the Southwest. A nascent merchant marine was assistedby grants of money, or by mail subsidies, so that our steam shipping might ply the sevenseas. Some of my friends tell me that they do not want the Government in business. Withthis I agree; but I wonder whether they realize the implications of the past. For while ithas been American doctrine that the government must not go into business in competitionwith private enterprises, still it has been traditional particularly in Republicanadministrations for business urgently to ask the government to put at private disposal allkinds of government assistance. The same man who tells you that he does not want to see thegovernment interfere in business-and he means it, and has plenty of good reasons forsaying so-is the first to go to Washington and ask the government for a prohibitory tariffon his product. When things get just bad enough --as they did two years ago -- he will go withequal speed to the United States government and ask for a loan; and the ReconstructionFinance Corporation is the outcome of it. Each group has sought protection from thegovernment for its own special interest, without realizing that the function of governmentmust be to favor no small group at the expense of its duty to protect the rights ofpersonal freedom and of private property of all its citizens.In retrospect we can now see that the turn of the tide came with theturn of the century. We were reaching our last frontier; there was no more free land andour industrial combinations had become great uncontrolled and irresponsible units of powerwithin the state. Clear-sighted men saw with fear the danger that opportunity would nolonger be equal; that the growing corporation, like the feudal baron of old, mightthreaten the economic freedom of individuals to earn a living. In that hour, our antitrustlaws were born. The cry was raised against the great corporations. Theodore Roosevelt, thefirst great Republican progressive, fought a Presidential campaign on the issue of&#147;trust busting&#148; and talked freely about malefactors of great wealth. If thegovernment had a policy it was rather to turn the clock back, to destroy the largecombinations and to return to the time when every man owned his individual small business.This was impossible; Theodore Roosevelt, abandoning the idea of&#147;trust busting&#147;, was forced to work out a difference between &#147;good&#148;trusts and &#147;bad&#148; trusts. The Supreme Court set forth the famous &#147;rule ofreason&#148; by which it seems to have meant that a concentration of industrial power waspermissible if the method by which it got its power, and the use it made of that power,was reasonable.Woodrow Wilson, elected in 1912, saw the situation more clearly.Where Jefferson had feared the encroachment of political power on the lives ofindividuals, Wilson knew that the new power was financial. He say, in the highlycentralized economic system, the depot of the twentieth century, on whom great masses ofindividuals relied for their safety and their livelihood, and whose irresponsibility andgreed (if it were not controlled) would reduce them to starvation and penury. Theconcentration of financial power had not proceeded so far in 1912 as it has today; but ithad grown far enough for Mr. Wilson to realize fully its implications. It is interesting,now, to read his speeches. What is called &#147;radical&#148; today (and I have reason to knowwhereof I speak) is mild compared to the campaign of Mr. Wilson. &#147;No man candeny,&#148; he said, &#147;that the lines of endeavor have more and more narrowed andstiffened; no man who knows anything about the development of industry in this country canhave failed to observe that the larger kinds of credit are more and more difficult toobtain unless you obtain them upon terms of uniting your efforts with those who alreadycontrol the industry of the country, and nobody can fail to observe that every man whotries to set himself up in competition with any process of manufacture which has takenplace under the control of large combinations of capital will presently find himselfeither squeezed out or obliged to sell and allow himself to be absorbed.&#148; Had there been no World War -- had Mr. Wilson been able to devoteeight years to domestic instead of to international affairs -- we might have had a whollydifferent situation at the present time. However, the then distant roar of Europeancannon, growing ever louder, forced him to abandon the study of this issue. The problem hesaw so clearly is left with us as a legacy; and no one of us on either side of thepolitical controversy can deny that it is a matter of grave concern to the government.A glance at the situation today only too clearly indicates thatequality of opportunity as we have know it no longer exists. Our industrial plant isbuilt; the problem just now is whether under existing conditions it is not overbuilt. Ourlast frontier has long since been reached, and there is practically no more free land.More than half of our people do not live on the farms or on lands and cannot derive aliving by cultivating their own property. There is no safety valve in the from of aWestern prairie to which those thrown out of work by the Eastern economic machines can gofor a new start. We are not able to invite the immigration from Europe to share ourendless plenty. We are now providing a drab living for our own people.Our system of constantly rising tariffs has at last reacted againstus to the point of closing our Canadian frontier on the north, our European markets on theeast, many of our Latin American markets to the south, and a goodly proportion of ourPacific markets on the west, through the retaliatory tariffs of those countries. It hasforced many of our great industrial institutions who exported their surplus production tosuch countries, to establish plants in such countries within the tariff walls. This hasresulted in the reduction of the operation of their American plants, and opportunity foremployment.Just as freedom to farm has ceased, so also the opportunity inbusiness has narrowed. It still is true that men can start small enterprises, trusting tonative shrewdness and ability to keep abreast of competitors; but area after area has beenpreempted altogether by the great corporations, and even in the fields which still have nogreat concerns, the small man starts with a handicap. The unfeeling statistics of the pastthree decades show that the independent business man is running a losing race. Perhaps heis forced to the wall; perhaps he cannot command credit; perhaps he is &#147;squeezedout,&#148; in Mr. Wilson&#146;s words, by highly organized corporate competitors, as yourcorner grocery man can tell you. Recently a careful study was made of the concentration of businessin the United States. It showed that our economic life was dominated by some six hundredodd corporations who controlled two-thirds of American industry. Ten million smallbusiness men divided the other third. More striking still, it appeared that if the processof concentration goes on at the same rate, at the end of another century we shall have allAmerican industry controlled by a dozen corporations, and run by perhaps a hundred men.Put plainly, we are steering a steady course toward economic oligarchy, if we are notthere already.Clearly, all this calls for a reappraisal of values. A mere builderof more industrial plants, a creator of more railroad systems, and organizer of morecorporations, is as likely to be a danger as a help. The day of the great promoter or thefinancial Titan, to whom we granted anything if only he would build, or develop, is over.Our task now is not discovery or exploitation of natural resources, or necessarilyproducing more goods. It is the soberer, less dramatic business of administering resourcesand plants already in hand, of seeking to reestablish foreign markets for our surplusproduction, of meeting the problem of under consumption, of adjusting production toconsumption, of distributing wealth and products more equitably, of adapting existingeconomic organizations to the service of the people. The day of enlightened administrationhas come.Just as in older times the central government was first a haven ofrefuge, and then a threat, so now in a closer economic system the central and ambitiousfinancial unit is no longer a servant of national desire, but a danger. I would draw theparallel one step farther. We did not think because national government had become athreat in the 18th century that therefore we should abandon the principle of nationalgovernment. Nor today should we abandon the principle of strong economic units calledcorporations, merely because their power is susceptible of easy abuse. In other times wedealt with the problem of an unduly ambitious central government by modifying it graduallyinto a constitutional democratic government. So today we are modifying and controlling oureconomic units.As I see it, the task of government in its relation to business isto assist the development of an economic declaration of rights, an economic constitutionalorder. This is the common task of statesman and business man. It is the minimumrequirement of a more permanently safe order of things.Every man has a right to life; and this means that he has also aright to make a comfortable living. He may by sloth or crime decline to exercise thatright; but it may not be denied him. We have no actual famine or death; our industrial andagricultural mechanism can produce enough and to spare. Our government formal andinformal., political and economic, owes to every one an avenue to possess himself of aportion of that plenty sufficient for his needs, through his own work.Every man has a right to his own property; which means a right to beassured, to the fullest extent attainable, in the safety of his savings. By no other meanscan men carry the burdens of those parts of life which, in the nature of things afford nochance of labor; childhood, sickness, old age. In all thought of property, this right isparamount; all other property rights must yield to it. If, in accord with this principle,we must restrict the operations of the speculator, the manipulator, even the financier, Ibelieve we must accept the restriction as needful, not to hamper individualism but toprotect it. These two requirements must be satisfied, in the main, by theindividuals who claim and hold control of the great industrial and financial combinationswhich dominate so large a pert of our industrial life. They have undertaken to be, notbusiness men, but princes-princes of property. I am not prepared to say that the systemwhich produces them is wrong. I am very clear that they must fearlessly and competentlyassume the responsibility which goes with the power. So many enlightened business men knowthis that the statement would be little more that a platitude, were it not for an addedimplication.This implication is, briefly, that the responsible heads of financeand industry instead of acting each for himself, must work together to achieve the commonend. They must, where necessary, sacrifice this or that private advantage; and inreciprocal self-denial must seek a general advantage. It is here that formalgovernment-political government, if you choose, comes in. Whenever in the pursuit of thisobjective the lone wolf, the unethical competitor, the reckless promoter, the Ishmael orInsull whose hand is against every man&#146;s, declines to join in achieving and endrecognized as being for the public welfare, and threatens to drag the industry back to astate of anarchy, the government may properly be asked to apply restraint. Likewise,should the group ever use its collective power contrary to public welfare, the governmentmust be swift to enter and protect the public interest. The government should assume the function of economic regulationonly as a last resort, to be tried only when private initiative, inspired by highresponsibility, with such assistance and balance as government can give, has finallyfailed. As yet there has been no final failure, because there has been no attempt, and Idecline to assume that this nation is unable to meet the situation.The final term of the high contract was for liberty and the pursuitof happiness. We have learnt a great deal of both in the past century. We know thatindividual liberty and individual happiness mean nothing unless both are ordered in thesense that one man&#146;s meat is not another man&#146;s poison. We know that the old&#147;rights of personal competency&#148;-the right to read, to think, to speak to chooseand live a mode of life, must be respected at all hazards. We know that liberty to doanything which deprives others of those elemental rights is outside the protection of anycompact; and that government in this regard is the maintenance of a balance, within whichevery individual may have a place if he will take it; in which every individual may findsafety if he wishes it; in which every individual may attain such power as his abilitypermits, consistent with his assuming the accompanying responsibility....Faith in America, faith in our tradition of personal responsibility,faith in our institutions, faith in ourselves demands that we recognize the new terms ofthe old social contract. We shall fulfill them, as we fulfilled the obligation of theapparent Utopia which Jefferson imagined for us in 1776, and which Jefferson, Rooseveltand Wilson sought to bring to realization. We must do so, lest a rising tide of miseryengendered by our common failure, engulf us all. But failure is not an American habit; andin the strength of great hope we must all shoulder our common load.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,74," Woodrow Wilson -- First Inaugural AddressWoodrow WilsonFirst Inaugural Address delivered 4 April 1913 for flashThere has been a change of government. It began two years ago, when the House of Representatives became Democratic by a decisive majority. It has now been completed. The Senate about to assemble will also be Democratic. The offices of President and Vice-President have been put into the hands of Democrats. What does the change mean? That is the question that is uppermost in our minds to-day. That is the question I am going to try to answer, in order, if I may, to interpret the occasion.It means much more than the mere success of a party. The success of a party means little except when the Nation is using that party for a large and definite purpose. No one can mistake the purpose for which the Nation now seeks to use the Democratic Party. It seeks to use it to interpret a change in its own plans and point of view. Some old things with which we had grown familiar, and which had begun to creep into the very habit of our thought and of our lives, have altered their aspect as we have latterly looked critically upon them, with fresh, awakened eyes; have dropped their disguises and shown themselves alien and sinister. Some new things, as we look frankly upon them, willing to comprehend their real character, have come to assume the aspect of things long believed in and familiar, stuff of our own convictions. We have been refreshed by a new insight into our own life.We see that in many things that life is very great. It is incomparably great in its material aspects, in its body of wealth, in the diversity and sweep of its energy, in the industries which have been conceived and built up by the genius of individual men and the limitless enterprise of groups of men. It is great, also, very great, in its moral force. Nowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more striking forms the beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in their efforts to rectify wrong, alleviate suffering, and set the weak in the way of strength and hope. We have built up, moreover, a great system of government, which has stood through a long age as in many respects a model for those who seek to set liberty upon foundations that will endure against fortuitous change, against storm and accident. Our life contains every great thing, and contains it in rich abundance.But the evil has come with the good, and much fine gold has been corroded. With riches has come inexcusable waste. We have squandered a great part of what we might have used, and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature, without which our genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent, scorning to be careful, shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient. We have been proud of our industrial achievements, but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count the human cost, the cost of lives snuffed out, of energies overtaxed and broken, the fearful physical and spiritual cost to the men and women and children upon whom the dead weight and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly the years through. The groans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears, the solemn, moving undertone of our life, coming up out of the mines and factories, and out of every home where the struggle had its intimate and familiar seat. With the great Government went many deep secret things which we too long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid, fearless eyes. The great Government we loved has too often been made use of for private and selfish purposes, and those who used it had forgotten the people.At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and vital. With this vision we approach new affairs. Our duty is to cleanse, to reconsider, to restore, to correct the evil without impairing the good, to purify and humanize every process of our common life without weakening or sentimentalizing it. There has been something crude and heartless and unfeeling in our haste to succeed and be great. Our thought has been Let every man look out for himself, let every generation look out for itself, while we reared giant machinery which made it impossible that any but those who stood at the levers of control should have a chance to look out for themselves. We had not forgotten our morals. We remembered well enough that we had set up a policy which was meant to serve the humblest as well as the most powerful, with an eye single to the standards of justice and fair play, and remembered it with pride. But we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great.5 We have come now to the sober second thought. The scales of heedlessness have fallen from our eyes. We have made up our minds to square every process of our national life again with the standards we so proudly set up at the beginning and have always carried at our hearts. Our work is a work of restoration.We have itemized with some degree of particularity the things that ought to be altered and here are some of the chief items: A tariff which cuts us off from our proper part in the commerce of the world, violates the just principles of taxation, and makes the Government a facile instrument in the hand of private interests; a banking and currency system based upon the necessity of the Government to sell its bonds fifty years ago and perfectly adapted to concentrating cash and restricting credits; an industrial system which, take it on all its sides, financial as well as administrative, holds capital in leading strings, restricts the liberties and limits the opportunities of labor, and exploits without renewing or conserving the natural resources of the country; a body of agricultural activities never yet given the efficiency of great business undertakings or served as it should be through the instrumentality of science taken directly to the farm, or afforded the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs; watercourses undeveloped, waste places unreclaimed, forests untended, fast disappearing without plan or prospect of renewal, un-regarded waste heaps at every mine. We have studied as perhaps no other nation has the most effective means of production, but we have not studied cost or economy as we should either as organizers of industry, as statesmen, or as individuals.Nor have we studied and perfected the means by which government may be put at the service of humanity, in safeguarding the health of the Nation, the health of its men and its women and its children, as well as their rights in the struggle for existence. This is no sentimental duty. The firm basis of government is justice, not pity. These are matters of justice. There can be no equality or opportunity, the first essential of justice in the body politic, if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives, their very vitality, from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they can not alter, control, or singly cope with. Society must see to it that it does not itself crush or weaken or damage its own constituent parts. The first duty of law is to keep sound the society it serves. Sanitary laws, pure food laws, and laws determining conditions of labor which individuals are powerless to determine for themselves are intimate parts of the very business of justice and legal efficiency.These are some of the things we ought to do, and not leave the others undone, the old-fashioned, never-to-be-neglected, fundamental safeguarding of property and of individual right. This is the high enterprise of the new day: To lift everything that concerns our life as a Nation to the light that shines from the hearthfire of every man's conscience and vision of the right. It is inconceivable that we should do this as partisans; it is inconceivable we should do it in ignorance of the facts as they are or in blind haste. We shall restore, not destroy. We shall deal with our economic system as it is and as it may be modified, not as it might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to write upon; and step by step we shall make it what it should be, in the spirit of those who question their own wisdom and seek counsel and knowledge, not shallow self-satisfaction or the excitement of excursions whither they can not tell. Justice, and only justice, shall always be our motto.And yet it will be no cool process of mere science. The Nation has been deeply stirred, stirred by a solemn passion, stirred by the knowledge of wrong, of ideals lost, of government too often debauched and made an instrument of evil. The feelings with which we face this new age of right and opportunity sweep across our heartstrings like some air out of God's own presence, where justice and mercy are reconciled and the judge and the brother are one. We know our task to be no mere task of politics but a task which shall search us through and through, whether we be able to understand our time and the need of our people, whether we be indeed their spokesmen and interpreters, whether we have the pure heart to comprehend and the rectified will to choose our high course of action.This is not a day of triumph; it is a day of dedication. Here muster, not the forces of party, but the forces of humanity. Men's hearts wait upon us; men's lives hang in the balance; men's hopes call upon us to say what we will do. Who shall live up to the great trust? Who dares fail to try? I summon all honest men, all patriotic, all forward-looking men, to my side. God helping me, I will not fail them, if they will but counsel and sustain me!Image Source:U.S. Library of CongressCopyright Status:Text and Image = Public domain.Top 100 American SpeechesOnline Speech Bankå© Copyright 2001-Present.

I didn't wanna spend too much time on that 'cause I don't think it's important enough. But one thing is worth considering.He's the -- He's the nominal head of an organization supposedly representative of the undergraduates. Whereas in fact under the current directorit derives-- its authority is delegated power from the Administration. It's totally unrepresentative of the graduate students and TAs.å_But he made the following statement (I quote): I would ask all those who are not definitely committed to the FSMå_ cause to stay away from demonstration. Alright, now listen to this: For all upper division students who are interested in alleviating the TA shortage problem, I would encourage you to offer your services to Department Chairmen and Advisors. That has two things: A strike breaker and a fink.I'd like to say -- like to say one other thing about a union problem. Upstairs you may have noticed they're ready on the 2nd floor of Sproul Hall, Locals 40 and 127 of the Painters Union are painting the inside of the 2nd floor of Sproul Hall. Now, apparently that action had been planned some time in the past. I've tried to contact those unions. Unfortunately -- and [it] tears my heart out -- they're as bureaucratized as the Administration. It's difficult to get through to anyone in authority there. Very sad. We're still -- We're still making an attempt. Those people up there have no desire to interfere with what we're doing. I would ask that they be considered and that they not be heckled in any way. And I think that -- you know -- while there's unfortunately no sense of -- no sense of solidarity at this point between unions and students, there at least need be no -- you know -- excessively hard feelings between the two groups.Now, there are at least two ways in which sit-ins and civil disobedience and whatever -- least two major ways in which it can occur. One, when a law exists, is promulgated, which is totally unacceptable to people and they violate it again and again and again till it's rescinded, appealed. Alright, but there's another way. There's another way. Sometimes, the form of the law is such as to render impossible its effective violation -- as a method to have it repealed. Sometimes, the grievances of people are more -- extend more -- to more than just the law, extend to a whole mode of arbitrary power, a whole mode of arbitrary exercise of arbitrary power.And that's what we have here. We have an autocracy which -- which runs this university. It's managed. We were told the following: If President Kerr actually tried to get something more liberal out of the Regents in his telephone conversation, why didn't he make some public statement to that effect? And the answer we received -- from a well-meaning liberal -- was the following: He said, Would you ever imagine the manager of a firm making a statement publicly in opposition to his Board of Directors? That's the answer. Well I ask you to consider -- if this is a firm, and if the Board of Regents are the Board of Directors, and if President Kerr in fact is the manager, then I tell you something -- the faculty are a bunch of employees and we're the raw material! But we're a bunch of raw materials that don't mean to be -- have any process upon us. Don't mean to be made into any product! Don't mean -- Don't mean to end up being bought by some clients of the University, be they the government, be they industry, be they organized labor, be they anyone! We're human beings!And that -- that brings me to the second mode of civil disobedience. There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part! You can't even passively take part! And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus -- and you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it -- that unless you're free the machine will be prevented from working at all!!That doesn't mean -- I know it will be interpreted to mean, unfortunately, by the bigots who run The Examiner, for example -- That doesn't mean that you have to break anything. One thousand people sitting down some place, not letting anybody by, not [letting] anything happen, can stop any machine, including this machine! And it will stop!!We're gonna do the following -- and the greater the number of people, the safer they'll be and the more effective it will be. We're going, once again, to march up to the 2nd floor of Sproul Hall. And we're gonna conduct our lives for awhile in the 2nd floor of Sproul Hall. We'll show movies, for example. We tried to get Un Chant d'Amour and [they] shut them off. Unfortunately, that's tied up in the court because of a lot of squeamish moral mothers for a moral America and other people on the outside. The same people who get all their ideas out of the San Francisco Examiner. Sad, sad. But, Mr. Landau -- Mr. Landau has gotten us some other films.Likewise, we'll do something -- we'll do something which hasn't occurred at this University in a good long time! We're going to have real classes up there! They're gonna be freedom schools conducted up there! We're going to have classes on [the] 1st and 14th amendments!! We're gonna spend our time learning about the things this University is afraid that we know! We're going to learn about freedom up there, and we're going to learn by doing!!Now, we've had some good, long rallies. [Rally organizers inform Savio that Joan Baez has arrived.] Just one moment. We've had some good, long rallies. And I think I'm sicker of rallies than anyone else here. She's not going to be long. I'd like to introduce one last person -- one last person before we enter Sproul Hall. Yeah. And the person is Joan Baez.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Eleven years ago, while giving birth to myfirst child, I hemorrhaged and was transfused with seven pints of blood. Four years later,I found out that I had been infected with the AIDS virus and had unknowingly passed it to my daughter, Ariel, through my breast milk, and my son, Jake, in utero.Twenty years ago I wanted to be at the Democratic Convention becauseit was a way to participate in my country. Today, I am here because it's a matter of lifeand death. Exactly -- Exactly four years ago my daughter died of AIDS. She did not survive the ReaganAdministration. I am here because my son and I may not survive four more years of leaderswho say they care, but do nothing. I -- I am in a race with the clock. This is not about beinga Republican or an Independent or a Democrat. It's about the future -- for each and everyone of us.I started out just a mom -- fighting for the life of her child. Butalong the way I learned how unfair America can be today, not just for people who have HIV,but for many, many people -- poor people, gay people, people of color, children. A strange spokespersonfor such a group: a well-to-do white woman. But I have learned my lesson the hard way,and I know that America has lost her path and is at risk of losing her soul. America wakeup: We are all in a struggle between life and death.I understand -- I understand the sense of frustration and despair in our country,because I know firsthand about shouting for help and getting no answer. I went toWashington to tell Presidents Reagan and Bush that much, much more had to be done for AIDS research and care, and that children couldn't be forgotten. The first time, when nothing happened, I thought, They just didn't hear me. The second time, when nothing happened, Ithought, Maybe I didn't shout loud enough. But now I realize they don't hear becausethey don't want to listen.When you cry for help and no one listens, you start to loseyour hope. I began to lose faith in America. I felt my country was lettingme down -- and it was. This is not the America I was raised to be proud of. I was raised tobelieve that other's problems were my problems as well. But when I tell most people aboutHIV, in hopes that they will help and care, I see the look in their eyes: It's not myproblem, they're thinking. Well, it's everyone's problem and we need a leader who will tellus that. We need a visionary to guide us -- to say it wasn't all right for Ryan White to be banned from school because he had AIDS, to say it wasn't alright for a man or a woman to be denied a job becausethey're infected with this virus. We need a leader who is truly committed to educatingus.I believe in America, but not with a leadership of selfishness andgreed -- where the wealthy get health care and insurance and the poor don't. Do you know -- Do you know howmuch my AIDS care costs? Over 40,000 dollars a year. Someone without insurance can't affordthis. Even the drugs that I hope will keep me alive are out of reach for others. Is theirlife any less valuable? Of course not. This is not the America I was raised to be proudof -- where rich people get care and drugs that poor people can't. We need health carefor all. We need a leader who will say this and do something about it.I believe in America, but not a leadership that talks aboutproblems but is incapable of solving them -- two HIV commission reports with recommendationsabout what to do to solve this crisis sitting on shelves, gathering dust. We need aleader who will not only listen to these recommendations, but implement them.I believe in America, but not with a leadership that doesn't holdgovernment accountable. I go to Washington to the National Institutes of Health and say,Show me what you're doing on HIV. They hate it when I come because I try totell them how to do it better. But that's why I love being a taxpayer, because it's mymoney and they must feel accountable.I believe in an America where our leaders talk straight. When anyonetells President Bush that the battle against AIDS is seriously under-funded, he jugglesthe numbers to mislead the public into thinking we're spending twice as much as we reallyare. While they play games with numbers, people are dying.I believe in America, but an America where there is a light in everyhome. A thousand points of light just wasn't enough: My house has been dark for toolong.Once every generation, history brings us to an important crossroads.Sometimes in life there is that moment when it's possible to make a change for the better.This is one of those moments.For me, this is not politics. This is a crisis of caring.In this hall is the future -- women, men of all colors saying, TakeAmerica back. We are -- We are just real people wanting a more hopeful life. But words and ideas arenot enough. Good thoughts won't save my family. What's the point of caring if we don't dosomething about it? A President and a Congress that can work togetherso we can get out of this gridlock and move ahead, because I don't win my war if the President cares and the Congress, or if the Congress cares and the President doesn't support the ideas.The people in this hall this week, the Democratic Party, all of uscan begin to deliver that partnership, and in November we can all bring it home.My daughter lived seven years, and in her last year, when shecouldn't walk or talk, her wisdom shone through. She taught me to love, when all Iwanted to do was hate. She taught me to help others, when all I wanted to do was helpmyself. She taught me to be brave, when all I felt was fear.My daughter and I lovedeach other with simplicity. America, we can do the same.This was the country that offered hope. This was the place wheredreams could come true, not just economic dreams, but dreams of freedom, justice, andequality. We all need to hope that our dreams can come true. I challenge you to make ithappen, because all our lives, not just mine, depend on it.Thank you.Also in this database: Mary Fisher -- 1992 Republican National Convention AddressSee also: Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Foundation Status: Text, Image = Uncertain.2001-Present. .HTML transcription by Michael E.

Le GuinA Left-Handed Commencement Address delivered 22 May1983, Mills College, Oakland, California for flashI want to thank the Mills College Class of '83 for offering me a rare chance: to speak aloud in public in the language of women.I know there are men graduating, and I don't mean to exclude them, far from it. There is a Greek tragedy where the Greek says to the foreigner, åÒIf you don't understand Greek, please signify by nodding.åÓ Anyhow, commencements are usually operated under the unspoken agreement that everybody graduating is either male or ought to be. ThatåÕs why we are all wearing these twelfth-century dresses that look so great on men and make women look either like a mushroom or a pregnant stork.Intellectual tradition is male. Public speaking is done in the public tongue, the national or tribal language; and the language of our tribe is the men's language. Of course women learn it. We're not dumb. If you can tell Margaret Thatcher from Ronald Reagan, or Indira Gandhi from General Somoza, by anything they say, tell me how. This is a manåÕs world, so it talks a manåÕs language. The words are all words of power. YouåÕve come a long way, baby, but no way is long enough. You canåÕt even get there by selling yourself out: because there is theirs, not yours.Maybe weåÕve had enough words of power and talk about the battle of life. Maybe we need some words of weakness. Instead of saying now that I hope you will all go forth from this ivory tower of college into the Real World and forge a triumphant career or at least help your husband to and keep our country strong and be a success in everything -- instead of talking about power, what if I talked like a woman right here in public? It wonåÕt sound right. ItåÕs going to sound terrible. What if I said what I hope for you is first, if -- only if -- you want kids, I hope you have them. Not hordes of them. A couple, enough. I hope theyåÕre beautiful. I hope you and they have enough to eat, and a place to be warm and clean in, and friends, and work you like doing.Well, is that what you went to college for? Is that all? What about success?Success is somebody elseåÕs failure. Success is the American Dream we can keep dreaming because most people in most places, including thirty million of ourselves, live wide awake in the terrible reality of poverty. No, I do not wish you success. I donåÕt even want to talk about it. I want to talk about failure.Because you are human beings you are going to meet failure. You are going to meet disappointment, injustice, betrayal, and irreparable loss. You will find youåÕre weak where you thought yourself strong. YouåÕll work for possessions and then find they possess you. You will find yourself -- as I know you already have -- in dark places, alone, and afraid.What I hope for you, for all my sisters and daughters, brothers and sons, is that you will be able to live there, in the dark place. To live in the place that our rationalizing culture of success denies, calling it a place of exile, uninhabitable, foreign.Well, weåÕre already foreigners. Women as women are largely excluded from, alien to, the self-declared male norms of this society, where human beings are called Man, the only respectable god is male, the only direction is up. So thatåÕs their country; letåÕs explore our own. IåÕm not talking about sex; thatåÕs a whole other universe, where every man and woman is on their own. IåÕm talking about society, the so-called manåÕs world of institutionalized competition, aggression, violence, authority, and power.If we want to live as women, some separatism is forced upon us: Mills College is a wise embodiment of that separatism. The war-games world wasnåÕt made by us or for us; we canåÕt even breathe the air there without masks. And if you put the mask on youåÕll have a hard time getting it off.So how about going on doing things our own way, as to some extent you did here at Mills? Not for men and the male power hierarchy åÑ thatåÕs their game. Not against men, either åÑ thatåÕs still playing by their rules. But with any men who are with us: thatåÕs our game. Why should a free woman with a college education either fight Machoman or serve him? Why should she live her life on his terms?Machoman is afraid of our terms, which are not all rational, positive, competitive, etc. And so he has taught us to despise and deny them. In our society, women have lived, and have been despised for living, the whole side of life that includes and takes responsibility for helplessness, weakness, and illness, for the irrational and the irreparable, for all that is obscure, passive, uncontrolled, animal, unclean -- the valley of the shadow, the deep, the depths of life. All that the Warrior denies and refuses is left to us and the men who share it with us and therefore, like us, canåÕt play doctor, only nurse, canåÕt be warriors, only civilians, canåÕt be chiefs, only indians. Well so that is our country. The night side of our country. If there is a day side to it, high sierras, prairies of bright grass, we only know pioneersåÕ tales about it, we havenåÕt got there yet. WeåÕre never going to get there by imitating Machoman. We are only going to get there by going our own way, by living there, by living through the night in our own country.So what I hope for you is that you live there not as prisoners, ashamed of being women, consenting captives of a psychopathic social system, but as natives. That you will be at home there, keep house there, be your own mistress, with a room of your own. That you will do your work there, whatever youåÕre good at, art or science or tech or running a company or sweeping under the beds, and when they tell you that itåÕs second-class work because a woman is doing it, I hope you tell them to go to hell and while theyåÕre going to give you equal pay for equal time. I hope you live without the need to dominate, and without the need to be dominated. I hope you are never victims, but I hope you have no power over other people. And when you fail, and are defeated, and in pain, and in the dark, then I hope you will remember that darkness is your country, where you live, where no wars are fought and no wars are won, but where the future is.Our roots are in the dark; the earth is our country. Why did we look up for blessing -- instead of around, and down? What hope we have lies there. Not in the sky full of orbiting spy-eyes and weaponry, but in the earth we have looked down upon. Not from above, but from below. Not in the light that blinds, but in the dark that nourishes, where human beings grow human souls.Text Source:Ursula K.

Long -- Share Our Wealth Radio SpeechHuey P. LongRadio Speech - Share Our Wealth(as entered into the 12 March 1935 Congressional Records)Broadcast 7 March 1935, National Broadcasting Company, New York for flashLadies and gentlemen, it has been publicly announced that the White House orders of the Roosevelt administration have declared war on HUEY LONG. The late and lamented, the pampered ex-crown prince, Gen. Hugh S. Johnson, one of those satellites loaned by Wall Street to run the Government, and who, at the end of his control over and dismissal from the NRA, pronounced it as dead as a dodo, this Mr. Johnson was apparently selected to make the lead-off speech in this White House charge begun last Monday night. The Johnson speech was followed by more fuss and fury on behalf of the administration by spellbinders in and out of Congress.In a far-away island, when a queen dies, her first favorite is done the honor to be buried alive with her. The funeral procession of the NRA (another one of these new-deal schisms or isms) is about ready to occur. It is said that General Johnson's speech of Monday night to attack me was  delivered on the eve of announcing the publication of his obituary in the Red Book Magazine. Seems then that soon this erstwhile prince of the deranged alphabet makes ready to appear at the funeral of NRA like unto the colored lady in Mississippi who there asserted: I is de wife of dese remains.I shall undertake to cover my main subject and make answer to these gentlemen in the course of this speech tonight.It will serve no purpose to our distressed people for me to call my opponents more bitter names than they call me. Even were I able, I have not the time to present my side of the argument and match them in billingsgate or profanity.What is this trouble with this administration of Mr. [Franklin D.] Roosevelt, Mr. [Hugh S.] Johnson, Mr. [James A.] Farley,l Mr. [Vincent] Astor, and all their spoilers and spellbinders? They think that HUEY LONG is the cause of all their worry. They go gunning for me. But, am I the cause of their misery? They are like old Davy Crockett, who went out to hunt a possum. He saw in the gleam of the moonlight that a possum in the top of a tree was going from limb to limb. He shot and missed. He saw the possum again. He fired a second time and missed again. Soon he discovered that it was not a possum he saw at all in the top of that tree. It was a louse in his own eyebrow.I do not make this illustration to do discredit to any of these gentlemen. I make it to show how often we imagine we see great trouble being done to us by someone at a distance, when, in reality, all of it may be a fault in our own make-up.The trouble with the Roosevelt administration is that when their schemes and isms have failed, these things I told them not to do and voted not to do, that they think it will help them to light out on those of us who warned them in the beginning that the tangled messes and noble experiments would not work. The Roosevelt administration has had its way for two years. They have been allowed to set up or knock down anything and everybody. There was one difference between [Herbert] Hoover and Roosevelt. Hoover could not get the Congress to carry out the schemes he wanted to try. We managed to lick him on a roll call in the United States Senate time after time. But, different with Mr. Roosevelt. He got his plans through Congress. But on cold analysis they were found to be the same things Hoover tried to pass and failed.The kitchen cabinet that sat in to advise Hoover was not different from the kitchen cabinet which advised Roosevelt. Many of the persons are the same. Many of those in Roosevelt's kitchen cabinet are of the same men or set of men who furnished employees to sit in the kitchen cabinet to advise Hoover.Maybe you see a little change in the man waiting on the tables, but back in the kitchen the same set of cooks are fixing up the victuals for us that cooked up the mess under Hoover.Why, do you think this Roosevelt's plan for plowing up cotton, corn, and wheat; and for pouring milk in the river, and for destroying and burying hogs and cattle by the millions, all while people starve and go naked -- do you think those plans were the original ideas of this Roosevelt administration? If you do, you are wrong. The whole idea of that kind of thing first came from Hoover's administration. Don't you remember when Mr. Hoover proposed to plow up every fourth row of cotton? We laughed him into scorn. President Roosevelt flayed him for proposing such a thing in the speech which he made from the steps of the capitol in Topeka, Kans.And so we beat Mr. Hoover on his plan. But when Mr. Roosevelt started on his plan, it was not to plow up every fourth row of cotton as Hoover tried to do. Roosevelt's plan was to plow up every third row of cotton, just one-twelfth more cotton to be plowed up than Hoover proposed. Roosevelt succeeded in his plan.So it has been that while millions have starved and gone naked; so it has been that while babies have cried and died for milk; so it has been that while people have begged for meat and bread, Mr. Roosevelt's administration has sailed merrily along, plowing under and destroying the things to eat and to wear, with tear-dimmed eyes and hungry souls made to chant for this new deal so that even their starvation dole is not taken away, and meanwhile the food and clothes craved by their bodies and souls go for destruction and ruin. What is it? Is it government? Maybe so. It looks more like St. Vitus dance.Now, since they sallied forth with General Johnson to start the war on me, let us take a look at this NRA that they opened up around here two years ago. They had parades and Fascist signs just as Hitler, and Mussolini. They started the dictatorship here to regiment business and labor much more than anyone did in Germany or Italy. The only difference was in the sign. Italy's sign of the Fascist was a black shirt. Germany's sign of the Fascist was a swastika. So in America they sidetracked the Stars and Stripes, and the sign of the Blue Eagle was used instead.And they proceeded with the NRA. Everything from a peanut stand to a power house had to have a separate book of rules and laws to regulate what they did. If a peanut stand started to parch a sack of goobers for sale, they had to be careful to go through the rule book. One slip and he went to jail. A little fellow w ho pressed a pair of pants went to jail because he charged 5 cents under the price set in the rule book. So they wrote their NRA rule book, codes, laws, etc. They got up over 900 of them. One would be as thick as an unabridged dictionary and as confusing as a study of the stars. It would take 40 lawyers to tell a shoe-shine stand how to operate and be certain he didn't go to jail.Some people came to me for advice, as a lawyer, on how to run business. I took several days and then couldn't understand it myself. The only thing I could tell them was that it couldn't be much worse in jail than it was out of jail with that kind of thing going on in the country, and so to go on and do the best they could.The whole thing of Mr. Roosevelt, as run under General Johnson, became such a national scandal that Roosevelt had to let Johnson slide out as the scapegoat. Let them call for an NRA parade tomorrow and you couldn't get enough people to form a funeral march.It was under this NRA and the other funny alphabetical combinations which followed it that we ran the whole country into a mares nest. The Farleys and Johnsons combed the land with agents, inspectors, supervisors, detectives, secretaries, assistants, etc., all armed with the power to arrest and send to jail whomever they found not living up to some rule in one of these 900 catalogs. One man whose case reached the Supreme Court of the United States was turned loose because they couldn't even find the rule he was supposed to have violated in a search throughout the United States.And now it is with PWA's, CWA's, NRA's, AAA's, J-UG's, G-IN's, and every other flimsy combination that the country finds its affairs and business tangled to where no one can recognize it. More men are now out of work than ever; the debt of the United States has gone up another $10 billion. There is starvation; there is homelessness; there is misery on every hand and corner, but mind you, in the meantime, Mr. Roosevelt has had his way. He is one man that can't blame any of his troubles on HUEY LONG. He has had his way. Down in my part of the country if any man has the measles he blames that on me; but there is one man that can't blame anything on anybody but himself, and that is Mr. Franklin De-La-No Roosevelt.And now, on top of that, they order war on me because nearly 4 years ago I told Hoover's crowd it wouldn't do and because 3 years ago I told Roosevelt and his crowd it wouldn't do. In other words, they are in a rage at HUEY LONG because I have said, I told you so.I am not overstating the conditions now prevailing in this country. In their own words they have confessed all I now say or ever have said. Mr. Roosevelt and even Mrs. Roosevelt have bewailed the fact that food, clothes, and shelter have not been provided for the people. Even Gen. Hugh S. Johnson said in his speech of Monday night that there are 80 million people in America who are badly hurt or wrecked by this depression. Mr. Harry Hopkins, who runs the relief work, says the dole roll has risen now to 22,375,000 persons, the highest it has ever been. And now, what is there for the Roosevelt crowd to do but to admit the facts and admit further that they are now on their third year, making matters worse instead of better all the time? No one is to blame, except them, for what is going on because they have had their way. And if they couldn't change the thing in over two years, now bogged down worse than ever, how could anyone expect any good of them hereafter? God save us two more years of the disaster we have had under that gang.Now, my friends, when this condition of distress and suffering among so many millions of our people began to develop in the Hoover administration, we knew then what the trouble was and what we would have to do to correct it. I was the first man to say publicly -- but Mr. Roosevelt followed in my tracks a few months later and said the same thing. We said that all of our trouble and woe was due to the fact that too few of our people owned too much of our wealth. We said that in our land, with too much to eat, and too much to wear, and too many houses to live in, too many automobiles to be sold, that the only trouble was that the people suffered in the land of abundance because too few controlled the money and the wealth and too many did not have money with which to buy the things they needed for life and comfort.So I said to the people of the United States in my speeches which I  delivered in the United States Senate in the early part of 1932 that the only way by which we could restore our people to reasonable life and comfort was to limit the size of the big man's fortune and guarantee some minimum to the fortune and comfort of the little man's family.I said then, as I have said since, that it was inhuman to have food rotting, cotton and wool going to waste, houses empty, and at the same time to have millions of our people starving, naked, and homeless because they could not buy the things which other men had and for which they had no use whatever. So we convinced Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt that it was necessary that he announce and promise to the American people that in the event he were elected President of the United States he would pull down the size of the big man's fortune and guarantee something to every family -- enough to do away with all poverty and to give employment to those who were able to work and education to the children born into the world.Mr. Roosevelt made those promises; he made them before he was nominated in the Chicago convention. He made them again before he was elected in November, and he went so far as to remake those promises after he was inaugurated President of the United States. And I thought for a day or two after he took the oath as President, that maybe he was going through with his promises. No heart was ever so saddened; no person's ambition was ever so blighted, as was mine when I came to the realization that the President of the United States was not going to undertake what he had said he would do, and what I know to be necessary if the people of America were ever saved from calamity and misery.So now, my friends, I come to that point where I must in a few sentences describe to you just what was the cause of our trouble which became so serious in 1929, and which has been worse ever since. The wealth in the United States was three times as much in 1910 as it was in 1890, and yet the masses of our people owned less in 1910 than they did in 1890. In the year 1916 the condition had become so bad that a committee provided for by the Congress of the United States reported that 2 percent of the people in the United States owned 60 percent of the wealth in the country, and that 65 percent of the people owned less than 5 percent of the wealth. This report showed, however, that there was a middle class -- some 33 percent of the people -- who owned 35 percent of the wealth. This report went on to say that the trouble with the American people at that time was that too much of the wealth was in the hands of too few of the people, and recommended that something be done to correct the evil condition then existing.It was at about the same time that many of our publications began to deplore the fact that so few people owned so much and that so many people owned so little. Among those commenting upon that situation was the Saturday Evening Post, which, in an issue of September 23, 1916, said: Along one statistical line you can figure out a Nation bustling with wealth; along another a bloated plutocracy comprising 1 percent of the population lording it over a starving horde with only a thin margin of merely well-to-do in between.And it was, as the Saturday Evening Post and the committee appointed by Congress said, it was a deplorable thing back in 1916, when it was found that 2 percent of the people owned twice as much as all of the remainder of the people put together, and that 65 percent of all of our people owned practically nothing.But what did we do to correct that condition? Instead of moving to take these big fortunes from the top and spreading them among the suffering people at the bottom, the financial masters of America moved in to take complete charge of the Government for fear our lawmakers might do something along that line.And as a result, 14 years after the report of 1916, the Federal Trade Commission made a study to see how the wealth of this land was distributed, and did they find it still as bad as it was in 1916? They found it worse! They found that 1 percent of the people owned about 59 percent of the wealth, which was almost twice as bad as what was said to be an intolerable condition in 1916, when 2 percent of the people owned 60 percent of the wealth. And as a result of foreclosures, failures, and bankruptcies, which began to happen prior to and in the year of 1929, before the campaign of 1932, and at this late date, it is the estimate of all conservative statisticians that 75 percent of the people in the United States don't own anything, that is, not enough to pay their debts, and that 4 percent of the people, or maybe less than 4 percent of the people, own from 85 to 90 percent of all our wealth in the United States.Remember, in 1916 there was a middle class -- 33 percent of the people -- who owned 35 percent of the wealth. That middle class is practically gone today. It no longer exists. They have dropped into the ranks of the poor. The thriving man of independent business standing is fast fading. The corner grocery store is becoming a thing of the past. Concentrated chain-merchandise and banking systems have laid waste to all middle opportunity. That thin margin of merely well-to-do in between which the Saturday Evening Post mentioned on September 23, 1916, has dwindled to practically no margin of well-to-do in between. Those suffering on the bottom and the few lords of finance on the top are nearly all that are left.It became apparent that the billionaires and multimillionaires even began to squeeze out the common millionaires, closing in and taking their properties and wrecking their businesses. And so we arrived (and are still there) at the place that in abundant America where we have everything for which a human heart can pray, the hundreds of millions -- or, as General Johnson says, the 80 million -- of our people are crying in misery for the want of the things which they need for life, notwithstanding the fact that the country has had and can have more than the entire human race can consume.The 125 million people of America have seated themselves at the barbecue table to consume the products which have been guaranteed to them by their Lord and Creator. There is provided by the Almighty what it takes for them all to eat; yea, more. There is provided more than what is needed for all to eat. But the financial masters of America have taken off the barbecue table 90 percent of the food placed thereon by God, through the labors of mankind, even before the feast begins, and there is left on that table to be eaten by 125 million people less than should be there for 10 million of them.What has become of the remainder of those things placed on the table by the Lord for the use of us all? They are in the hands of the Morgans, the Rockefellers, the Mellons, the Baruches, the Bakers, the Astors, and the Vanderbilts -- 600 families at the most either possessing or controlling the entire 90 percent of all that is in America. They cannot eat the food, they cannot wear the clothes, so they destroy it. They have it rotted; they plow it up; they pour it into the rivers; they bring destruction through the acts of mankind to let humanity suffer; to let humanity go naked; to let humanity go homeless, so that nothing may occur that will do harm to their vanity and to their greed. Like the dog in the manger, they command a wagon load of hay, which the dog would not allow the cow to eat, though he could not eat it himself.So now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to that plan of mine for which I have been so roundly denounced and condemned by such men as Mr. Farley, Mr. Robinson, and Gen. Hugh S. Johnson, and other spellers and speakers and spoilers of the Roosevelt administration. It is for the redistribution of wealth and for guaranteeing comforts and conveniences to all humanity out of this abundance in our country. I hope none will be horror-stricken when they hear me say that we must limit the size of the big man's fortune in order to guarantee a minimum of fortune, life and comfort to the little man; but, if you are, think first that such is the declaration on which Roosevelt rode into the nomination and election of President. While my urgings are declared by some to be the average of a madman, and by such men as General Johnson as insincere bait of a pied piper, if you will listen to me you will find that it is restating the laws handed down by God to man; you will find that it was the exact provision of the contract and law of the Pilgrim Fathers who landed at Plymouth in 1620.Here's what the Pilgrim Fathers said in the contract with the early settlers in the year 1620. I read you article 5 from that contract: 5: That at ye end of ye 7. years, ye capital &amp; profits, viz. the houses, lands, goods, and chattels, be equally divided betwixt ye adventurers, and planters; which done, every man shall be free from other of them of any debt or detriment concerning this adventure.So the Pilgrim Fathers wrote into the covenant to do just exactly what the Bible said to do, that they should have an equal division of the wealth every seven years. I don't go that far; I merely advocate that no man be allowed to become so big that he makes paupers out of a million other peopleYou will find that it is the cornerstone on which nearly every religion since the beginning of man has been founded. You will find that it was urged by Bacon, Milton, and Shakespeare in England, by Socrates, Plato, Theognis, and other wisest of men in Greece, by Pope Pius XI in the Vatican, by the world's greatest inventor, Marconi in Italy, by Daniel Webster, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, William Jennings Bryan, and Theodore Roosevelt in the United States, as well as by nearly all of the thousands of great men whose names are yet mentioned in history.The principle was not only the mainspring of Roosevelt's nomination and election, but in the closing speech of Herbert Hoover at Madison Square Garden in November 1932, even Hoover said:My conception of America is a land where men and women may walk in ordered liberty, where they may enjoy the advantages of wealth, not concentrated in the hands of a few but diffused through the lives of all.And so now I come to give you again that plan, taken from these leaders of all times and from the Bible, for the sponsoring of which I am labeled America's menace, madman, pied piper, and demagogue.I propose:First: That every big fortune shall be cut down immediately by a capital levy tax to where no one will own more than a few million dollars, as a matter of fact, to where no one can very long own a fortune in excess of about three to four millions of dollars. I propose that the surplus of all the big fortunes, above the few millions to any one person at the most, shall go into the United States ownership. How would we get all these surplus fortunes into the United States Treasury? Not hard to do. We would not do it by making everyone sell what he owned; no. We would send everyone a questionnaire. On that he would list the properties he owns, lands and houses, stocks and bonds, factories and patents, and so on. Every man would place his appraisal on his property, which the Government would review and maybe change on some items. On that appraisal the big fortune holder would say out of what property he would retain the few millions allowed to him, the balance to go to the United States. Say Mr. Henry Ford should allow that he owned all the stock of the Ford Motor Co., worth, say, $2 billion; he could claim, say $4 million of the Ford stock, but $1,996,000,000 would go to the United States. Say the Rockefeller fortune was listed at $10 billion in oil stocks, bank stocks, money, and stores. Each Rockefeller could say whether he wanted his limit in either the money, oil, or bank stocks, but about nine billion and eight hundred million would go to the Government. And so, in this way, the Government of the United States would come into the possession of about two-fifths of its wealth, which on normal values would be worth, say, $165 billion.Then we would turn to the inventories of the 25 million families of America. All those who showed properties and money clear of debts that were above $5,000 and up to the limit of a few millions would not be touched. But those showing less than $5,000 to the family free of debt would be added to, so that every family would start life again with homestead possessions of at least a home and the comforts needed for a home, including such things as a radio and an automobile. These things would go to every family as a homestead, not to be sold either for debts or taxes or even by consent of the owner except by the consent of the court or Government, and then only on condition that the court hold it to be spent for the purpose of buying another home and comforts thereof.Such would mean that the $165 billion or more taken from big fortunes would have about $100 billion of it used to provide all with the comforts of home and living. The Government might have to issue warrants for claim and location, or even currency to be retired from such property as was claimed, but all that is a detail not impractical to get these homes into the hands of the people.So America would start again with millionaires, but no multi-millionaires or billionaires; with some poor, but none too poor to be denied the comforts of life. America, however, would still have maybe a $65 billion balance from these big fortunes not yet used to set up the poor people. What would we do with that? Wait a moment. I am coming to that, too.Second: We propose that after homes and comforts of homes have been set up for the families of the country, that we shall turn our attention to the children and the youth of the land, providing first for their education and training. We would not have to worry about the problem of child labor, because the very first thing which we would place in front of every child would be not only a comfortable home during his early years but the opportunity for education and training, not only through the grammar school and the high school but through college and to include vocational and professional training for every child. If necessary, that would include the living cost of that child while he attended college, if one should be too distant for him to live at home and conveniently attend, as would be the case with many of those living in the rural areas.We now have an educational system, and in States like Louisiana -- and it is the best one -- where school books are furnished free to every child and where transportation by bus is given to every student, however far he may live from a grammar or high school; there is a fairly good assurance of education through grammar and high school for the child whose father and mother have enough at home to feed and clothe them. But when it comes to a matter of college education, except in few cases the right to a college education is determined at this day and time by the financial ability of the father and mother to pay for the cost and the expense of a college education. It don't make any difference how brilliant a boy or girl may be, that don't give them the right to a college education in America today.Now, Gen. Hugh Johnson says I am indeed a very smart demagogue, a wise and dangerous menace. But I am one of those who didn't have the opportunity to secure a college education or training. We propose that the right to education and the extent of education shall be determined and gauged not so much by the financial ability of the parents but by the mental ability and energy of a child to absorb the learning at a college. This should appeal to General Johnson, who says I am a smart man, since, had I enjoyed the learning and college training which my plan would provide for others, I might not have fallen into the path of the dangerous menace and demagogue that he has now found me to be.Remember, we have $65 billion to account for that would lie in the hands of the United States, even after providing home comforts for all families. We will use a large part of it immediately to expand particularly the colleges and universities of this country. You would not know the great institutions like Yale, Harvard, and Louisiana State University. Get ready for a surprise. College enrollments would multiply 1,000 percent. We would immediately call in the architects and engineers, the idle professors and scholars of learning. We would send out a hurry call because the problem of providing college education for all of the youth would start a fusillade of employment which might suddenly and immediately make it possible for us to shorten the hours of labor, even as we contemplate in the balance of our program.And how happy the youth of this land would be tomorrow morning if they knew instantly their right to a home and the comforts of a home and to complete college and professional training and education were assured! I know how happy they would be, because I know how I would have felt had such a message been  delivered to my door.I cannot deliver that promise to the youth of this land tonight, but I am doing my part. I am standing the blows; I am hearing the charges hurled at me from the four quarters of the country. It is the same fight which was made against me in Louisiana when I was undertaking to provide the free school books, free busses, university facilities, and things of that kind to educate the youth of that State as best I could. It is the same blare which I heard when I was undertaking to provide for the sick and the afflicted. When the youth of this land realizes what is meant and what is contemplated the billingsgate and the profanity of all the Farleys and Johnsons in America can't prevent the light of truth from hurling itself in understandable letters against the dark canopy of the sky.Now, when we have landed at the place where homes and comforts are provided for all families and complete education and training for all young men and women, the next problem is what about our income to sustain our people thereafter. How shall that be arranged to guarantee all the fair share of what soul and body need to sustain them conveniently. That brings us to our next point. We propose:Number 3: We shall shorten the hours of labor by law so much as may be necessary that none will be worked too long and none unemployed. We shall cut the hours of toil to 30 hours per week, maybe less; we may cut the working year to 11 months' work and 1 month's vacation; maybe less. If our great improvement programs show we need more labor than we may have, we will lengthen the hours as convenience requires. At all events, the hours for production will be gauged to meet the market for consumption. We will need all our machinery for many years, because we have much public improvement to do; and, further, the more use that we may make of them, the less toil will be required for all of us to survive in splendor.Now, a minimum earning would be established for any person with a family to support. It would be such a living which one, already owning a home, could maintain a family in comfort, of not less than $2,500 per year to every family.And now by reason of false statements made, particularly by Mr. Arthur Brisbane and Gen. Hugh S. Johnson, I must make answer to show you that there is more than enough in this country and more than enough raised and made every year to do what I propose.Mr. Brisbane says I am proposing to give every person $15,000 for a home and its comforts, and he says that would mean the United States would have to be worth over a trillion dollars. Why make that untrue statement, Mr. Brisbane? You know that is not so. I do not propose any home and comfort of $15,000 to each person -- it is a minimum of $5,000 to every family, which would be less than $125 billion, which is less than one-third of this Nation's wealth in normal times of $400 billion.General Johnson says that my proposal is for $5,000 guaranteed earning to each family, which he says would cost from four to five hundred millions of dollars per year, which he says is four times more than our whole national income ever has been. Why make such untrue statements, General Johnson? Must you be a false witness to argue your point? I do not propose $5,000 income per year to each family. I propose a minimum of from $2,000 to $2,500 income per year to each family. For 25 million families that minimum income per family would require from $50 billion to $60.6 billion. In the prosperous days we have had nearly double that for income some years already, which allowed plenty for the affluent; but with the unheard prosperity we would have, if all our people could buy what they need, our national income would be double what it has ever been.The Wall Street writer and statistician says we could have an income of at least $10,000 to every family in goods if all worked short hours and none were idle. According to him, only one-fourth of the average income would carry out my plan.And now I come to the remainder of the plan. We propose:Number 4: That agricultural production will be cared for in the manner specified in the Bible. We would plow under no crops; we would burn no corn; we would spill no milk into the river; we would shoot no hogs; would slaughter no cattle to be rotted. What we would do is this:We would raise all the cotton that we could raise, all the corn that we could raise, and everything else that we could raise. Let us say, f",,,79,"Gerald R. Ford -- On Taking the Oath of the Office of the  U.S. PresidencyGerald R. FordAddress Upon Taking the Oath of the  U.S. Presidency  delivered 9 August 1974 East Room  of the White House, Washington, D.C.  );  "", ""geraldfordoathofoffice."");   ;  click for pdf click for flash ][Oath of Office administered by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger] Mr. Chief Justice, my dear friends, my fellow Americans:  The oath that I have taken is the same oath that was taken by George Washington and by every President under the Constitution. But I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances never before experienced by Americans. This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts. Therefore, I feel it is my first duty to make an unprecedented compact with my countrymen. Not an inaugural address, not a fireside chat, not a campaign speech -- just a little straight talk among friends. And I intend it to be the first of many.I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your President by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your President with your prayers. And I hope that such prayers will also be the first of many. If you have not chosen me by secret ballot, neither have I gained office by any secret promises. I have not campaigned either for the Presidency or the Vice Presidency. I have not subscribed to any partisan platform. I am indebted to no man, and only to one woman -- my dear wife -- as I begin this very difficult job.I have not sought this enormous responsibility, but I will not shirk it. Those who nominated and confirmed me as Vice President were my friends and are my friends. They were of both parties, elected by all the people and acting under the Constitution in their name. It is only fitting then that I should pledge to them and to you that I will be the President of all the people. Thomas Jefferson said the people are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty. And down the years, Abraham Lincoln renewed this American article of faith asking, ""Is there any better way or equal hope in the world?""  I intend, on Monday next, to request of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate the privilege of appearing before the Congress to share with my former colleagues and with you, the American people, my views on the priority business of the Nation and to solicit your views and their views. And may I say to the Speaker and the others, if I could meet with you right after these remarks, I would appreciate it. Even though this is late in an election year, there is no way we can go forward except together and no way anybody can win except by serving the people's urgent needs. We cannot stand still or slip backwards. We must go forward now together.To the peoples and the governments of all friendly nations, and I hope that could encompass the whole world, I pledge an uninterrupted and sincere search for peace. America will remain strong and united, but its strength will remain dedicated to the safety and sanity of the entire family of man, as well as to our own precious freedom. I believe that truth is the glue that holds government together, not only our Government but civilization itself. That bond, though stained, is unbroken at home and abroad.In all my public and private acts as your President, I expect to follow my instincts of openness and candor with full confidence that honesty is always the best policy in the end.My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.  Our Constitution works. Our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here, the people rule. But there is a higher Power, by whatever name we honor Him, who ordains not only righteousness but love, not only justice but mercy. As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate. In the beginning, I asked you to pray for me. Before closing, I ask again your prayers, for Richard Nixon and for his family. May our former President, who brought peace to millions, find it for himself. May God bless and comfort his wonderful wife and daughters, whose love and loyalty will forever be a shining legacy to all who bear the lonely burdens of the White House. I can only guess at those burdens, although I have witnessed at close hand the tragedies that befell three Presidents and the lesser trials of others.With all the strength and all the good sense I have gained from life, with all the confidence of my family, my friends, and my dedicated staff impart to me, and with the good will of countless Americans I have encountered in recent visits to 40 States, I now solemnly reaffirm my promise I made to you last December 6: To uphold the Constitution; to do what is right as God gives me to see the right; and to do the very best I can for America.God helping me, I will not let you down.

",,,80," Cesar Chavez - The Mexican-American and the ChurchCesar E. ChavezThe Mexican-American and the ChurchPaper prepared by Mr. Chavez and presented in March 1968, Second Annual Mexican Conference in Sacramento, CaliforniaThe place to begin is with our own experiencewith the Church in the strike that has gone on for thirty-one months in Delano. For inDelano the Church has been involved with the poor in a unique way that should stand as asymbol to other communities. Of course, when we refer to the Church we should define theword a little. We mean the whole Church, the Church as an ecumenical body spread aroundthe world, and not just its particular form in a parish in a local community. The Church we are talking about is atremendously powerful institution in our society, and in the world. That Church is oneform of the Presence of God on Earth, and so naturally it is powerful. It is powerful bydefinition. It is a powerful moral and spiritual force which cannot be ignored by anymovement. Furthermore, it is an organization with tremendous wealth. Since the Church isto be servant to the poor, it is our fault if that wealth is not channeled to help thepoor in our world. In a small way we have been able, in the Delano strike, to worktogether with the Church in such a way as to bring some of its moral and economic power tobear on those who want to maintain the status quo, keeping farm workers in virtualenslavement. In brief, here is what happened in Delano. Some years ago, when some of us were workingwith the Community Service Organization, we began to realize the powerful effect which theChurch can have on the conscience of the opposition. In scattered instances, in San Jose,Sacramento, Oakland, Los Angeles and other places, priests would speak out loudly andclearly against specific instances of oppression, and in some cases, stand with the peoplewho were being hurt. Furthermore, a small group of priests, Frs. McDonald, McCollough,Duggan and others, began to pinpoint attention on the terrible situation of the farmworkers in our state. At about that same time, we began to run intothe California Migrant Ministry in the camps and field. They were about the only onesthere, and a lot of us were very suspicious, since we were Catholics and they wereProtestants. However, they had developed a very clear conception of the Church. It wascalled to serve, to be at the mercy of the poor, and not to try to use them. After a whilethis made a lot of sense to us, and we began to find ourselves working side by side withthem. In fact, it forced us to raise the question why ourChurchwas not doing the same. We would ask, why do the Protestants come outhere and help the people, demand nothing, and give all their time to serving farm workers,while our own parish priests stay in their churches, where only a few people come, andusually feel uncomfortable? It was not until some of us moved to Delano and beganworking to build the National Farm Workers Association that we really saw how far removedfrom the people the parish Church was. In fact, we could not get any help at all from thepriests of Delano. When the strike began, they told us we could not even use the Churchesauditorium for the meetings. The farm workers money helped build that auditorium! But theProtestants were there again, in the form of the California Migrant Ministry, and theybegan to help in little ways, here and there.When the strike started in 1965, most of ourfriends forsook us for a while. They ran- or were just too busy to help. But theCalifornia Migrant Ministry held a meeting with its staff and decided that the strike wasa matter of life or death for farm workers everywhere, and that even if it meant the endof the Migrant Ministry they would turn over their resources to the strikers. Thepolitical pressure on the Protestant Churches was tremendous and the Migrant Ministry losta lot of money. But they stuck it out, and they began to point the way to the rest of theChurch. In fact, when 30 of the strikers were arrested for shouting Huelga, 11ministers went to jail with them. They were in Delano that day at the request of ChrisHartmire, director of the California Migrant Ministry.Then the workers began to raise the question:why ministers? Why not priests? What does the Bishop say? But the Bishop said nothing. Butslowly the pressure of the people grew and grew, until finally we have in Delano a priestsent by the new Bishop, Timothy Manning, who is there to help minister to the needs offarm workers. His name is Father Mark Day and he is the Union&#146;s chaplain. Finally,our own Catholic Church has decided to recognize that we have our won peculiar needs, justas the growers have theirs. But outside of the local diocese, thepressure built up on growers to negotiate was tremendous. Though we were not allowed tohave our own priest, the power of the ecumenical body of the Church was tremendous. Thework of the Church, for example, in the Schenley, Di Giorgio, Perelly-Minetti strikes wasfantastic. They applied pressure- and they mediated. When poor people get involved in along conflict, such as a strike, or a civil rights drive, and the pressure increases eachday, there is a deep need for spiritual advice. Without it we see families crumble,leadership weaken, and hard workers grow tired. And in such a situation the spiritualadvice must be given by a friend, not by the opposition. What sense does it make to go toMass on Sunday and reach out for spiritual help, and instead get sermons about thewickedness of your cause? That only drives one to question and to despair. The growers in Delano have their spiritualproblems... we do not deny that. They have every right to have priests and ministers whoserve their needs. But we have different needs, and soweneeded a friendly spiritual guide. And this is true in every community inthis state where the poor face tremendous problems. But the opposition raises a tremendoushowl about this. They don't want us to have our spiritual advisors, friendly to our needs.Why is this? Why indeed except that THERE IS TREMENDOUS SPIRITUAL AND ECONOMIC POWER INTHE CHURCH. The rich know it, and for that reason they choose to keep it from the people. The leadership of the Mexican-AmericanCommunity must admit that we have fallen far short in our task of helping providespiritual guidance for our people. We may say, I don&#146;t feel any such need. I can getalong. But that is a poor excuse for not helping provide such help for others. For we canalso say, I don&#146;t need any welfare help. I can take care of my own problems But weare all willing to fight like hell for welfare aid for those who truly need it, who wouldstarve without it. Likewise we may have gotten an education and not care about scholarshipmoney for ourselves, or our children. But we would, we should, fight like hell to see toit that our state provides aid for any child needing it so that he can get the educationhe desires. Likewise we can say we don't need the Church.That is our business. But there are hundreds of thousands of our people who desperatelyneed some help from that powerful institution, the Church, and we are foolish not to helpthem get it. For example, the Catholic Charities agencies of the Catholic Church hasmillions of dollars earmarked for the poor. But often the money is spent for food basketsfor the needy instead of for effective action to eradicate the causes of poverty. The menand women who administer this money sincerely want to help their brothers. It should beour duty to help direct the attention to the basic needs of the Mexican-Americans in oursociety... needs which cannot be satisfied with baskets of food, but rather with effectiveorganizing at the grass roots level. Therefore, I am calling for Mexican-Americangroups to stop ignoring this source of power. It is not just our right to appeal to theChurch to use its power effectively for the poor, it is our duty to do so. It should be asnatural as appealing to government... and we do that often enough. Furthermore, we should be prepared to come tothe defense of that priest, rabbi, minister, or layman of the Church, who out ofcommitment to truth and justice gets into a tight place with his pastor or bishop. Itbehooves us to stand with that man and help him see his trial through. It is our duty tosee to it that his rights of conscience are respected and that no bishop, pastor or otherhigher body takes that God-given, human right away. Finally, in a nutshell, what do we want theChurch to do? We don&#146;t ask for more cathedrals. We don&#146;t ask for bigger churchesof fine gifts. We ask for its presence with us, beside us, as Christ among us. We ask theChurch to sacrifice with the people for social change, for justice, and for love ofbrother. We don&#146;t ask for words. We ask for deeds. We don&#146;t ask for paternalism.We ask for servanthood.More Information:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_ChavezUnited Farm Workers:http://www.ufw.org/Copyright Status:Text = Restricted, seek permission.

I am a defendant in this case, acting as my ownattorney, and therefore have the opportunity to address you directly. It is unusualfor a defendant to represent one&#146;s self, but my comrade, Mr. Pettis Perry and I haveelected to do so. Neither of us is a lawyer. We will speak to you in thelanguage of laymen and women, I should say.We are both Communist leaders, proudly and avowedly. We arequalified to explain to you what the Communist Party of the U.S.A. really stands for, whatit advocates, what its day-by-day activities are, and what are its ultimate aims. Wewill try to do so in simple, non-technical language. We will prove to you that weare not a criminal conspiracy but a 33-year-old working class political party, devoted tothe immediate needs and aspirations of the American people, to the advancement of theworkers, farmers and the Negro people, to the preservation of the democracy and culture,and to the advocacy of Socialism.Our ideas may be new and strange to you. Probably you havenever seen or met a Communist before. We don&#146;t ask you to agree with us but tolisten with an open mind and not to accept as gospel truth the sensational tales ofstool-pigeons and planted agents who will be the Government&#146;s chief, if not sole,witnesses.Centuries ago, Judas became the symbol of such infamy, a forerunnerof those who join a group of sincere and honest people, advocate its teachings, carry outits practices only to betray it.****** *We will prove to you that we who stand ready tomake extreme sacrifices for what we believe, are giving you a true picture of the purposesof the Communist Party.It is customary for a client to be introduced to the jury byhis or her attorney. I am my own attorney. I must therefore, introduce myself.I am an American of Irish decent. My father, Thomas Flynn, was born in Maine.My mother, Anne Gurley, was born in Galway, Ireland. I was born in Concord, NewHampshire, 62 years ago. I married in 1908, separated from my husband shortlythereafter, and have always used my own name. My only son, Fred, died in 1940 at theage of 29 from a chest cancer. I reside with my sister, who is a retired schoolteacher. We have lived in New York City for the past 52 years. My mother was askilled tailoress; my father a quarry worker who worked his way through the engineeringschool at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. My father, grandfather, and all myuncles were members of labor unions.****** * To continue, ladies and gentlemen, one of theessential issues in this case is my individual intent, the intent with which I joined theCommunist Party and have remained a member of it, and the intent with which I have triedto carry out its program. My intent has been shaped out of my earlier experiences and myreaction to the conditions of life, especially the conditions of the worker.By showing you what my intent is and what in my life shaped theintent, I shall show you that never have I, and not now do I, intend to advocate theoverthrow of government by force and violence, nor do I intend to bring about suchoverthrow.I come from a family whose day-by-day diet included important socialissues of the day, and form this I early learned to question things as they are and toseek improvements.Thus, my mother advocated Women&#146;s Suffrage, and my father andmother --****** *-- and my father and mother discussed with theirchildren the campaigns of Debs, the Socialist candidate for President.My father read aloud to me and to my brother and sisters such booksas the Communist Manifesto and other writings of Marx and Engels, which the Governmentwill use as evidence in this trial. I was a serious child, due probably to these childishimpressions which are background to my affiliation in my extreme youth with the Socialistmovement and in my mature years with the Communist Party.Times were hard. We were poor. My first experience withdiscrimination was in Manchester, New Hampshire, when my father ran for city engineerabout 1895. I heard it said he was defeated because he was Irish. He was verybitter on this subject and told us of signs on factories when he was a boy, &#147;No Irishneed apply.&#148;Our parents opposed all forms of national, religious or colordiscrimination, which we will prove is identical with the position of the Communist Partytoday and form the basis of the position I take today in the Communist Party.My first knowledge of the meaning of imperialism, which will be anissue in this case, was a vivid recollection of my father&#146;s opposition to theSpanish-American War and his insistence on the right of the Cuban and Philippine peoplesto their independence. He joined an anti-imperialist league to protest against ourcountry embarking on the evil path of imperialism, which we will prove began at that time.The conditions in the textile towns of New Hampshire andMassachusetts contributed to my later joining the Communist Party, which, as Mr. Lanesays, concentrates on the recruiting of workers in industry: huge gray mills, likeprisons, barrack-like company boarding houses, long hours, low wages, long periods ofslack; the prosperous owner lived in the center of Adams, Massachusetts, and rode aroundin his fine carriage with its beautiful horses.I saw lard instead of butter onneighbors&#146; tables, children without underwear in cold New England winters, a girlscalped by an unguarded machine in a mill across the street from our school. I saw an oldman weeping as they put him in the lockup as a tramp.Then we came to live in the drab South Bronx, near the New HavenRailroad&#146;s roundhouse, in a cold water, unheated, gas lit flat. Casualties andaccidents were high among the railroad workers. Children were maimed as theygathered coal in the yards in bad times.My mother helped women in the neighborhoodwho could not afford a doctor when a baby came.****** *Yes, I was greatly troubled by all this. Whydid good hard-working people suffer so? Why were men who were willing, able, andanxious to work, denied jobs? Why was there so much unemployment? Why werethere rich people who apparently did little but enjoyed life? I hated poverty.I saw my mother humiliated when unpaid grocery bills could not be met and the landlordstood at the door demanding his rent.****** *I joined a debating society in P.S. 9 in the lowerBronx. I won a medal in a debate on the subject, &#147;Should the Government own themines?&#148; I said, &#147;Yes, it should.&#148;This was during the great anthracite coal strike in 1902. Iattended Bronx Socialist meeting in 1905; later at the Harlem Socialist Club at 125thStreet. My speaking career started in 1906 on the ambitious subject of women undersocialism. Naturally, I drew heavily on authors, American women, like Charlotte Petingilland Susan B. Anthony, also on a book written in 1872 by Augustus Bebel, a Socialist memberof the German Reichstag, written while he was in prison under Bismarck&#146;santi-Socialist law. It was first published here by the Socialist Labor Party in1904. I am puzzled to see it on the Government&#146;s list of documents. Whatrelation it has to this indictment is hard to fathom, unless to advocate the fullpolitical, economic, and social emancipation of women has become a form of advocacy of theoverthrow of government by force and violence under the Government&#146;s interpretationof the Smith Act.But if this historic and economic study, which is very much out ofdate today, is to be finely tooth-combed for sentences which torn out of context candistort its meaning, this, we will prove, can be done to any book, no matter what itspurpose, even to the Bible, Shakespeare, or Gray&#146;s Anatomy.My youthful ambition, believe it or not, was to be a constitutionallawyer. Instead, I became a labor organizer. Then it was call an agitator, or,by the press, one who stirred up the people. I was determined to do something aboutthe bad conditions under which our family and all around us suffered. I have stuckto that purpose for 46 years. I consider in so doing I have been a goodAmerican. I have spent my life among the American workers all over this country,slept in their homes, eaten at their tables. They are the majority of the people whohave the inalienable right in our view to govern the country. We mean by workers,all who do useful work of hand or brain. My life work began when I joined theI.W.W., Industrial Workers of the World, in 1906, a pioneer in industrial unions whichflashed like a great comet across the horizon of the American labor movement for nearlytwo decades. I returned as an I.W.W. organizer in 1912 to New England, mybirthplace, where the I.W.W. led historical textile strikes in Lawrence, Lowell, and NewBedford, Massachusetts. The strikes were unorganized, largely foreign-born men andwomen whose wages were cut when their hours were reduced by Massachusetts law.****** *In 1913 I was a leader in the Paterson, New Jerseysilk strike; in 1916, in a strike of the iron ore miners on the Mesaba range in Minnesota,where the mines are owned by the U.S. Street trust, I will attempt to prove to you that itis not the Communists who advocate and use force and violence. I saw it used in allof these labor struggles, not by the workers but by police, company guards and Statemilitia. I saw workers clubbed, beaten and shot down. I spoke --****** *My travels as a Communist speaker have taken meall over the country. I saw the fruits of a lawless, aggressive, brutal and ruthlesscapitalism which garnered profits for a few at the expense of the many.Our country is a rich and beautiful country, fully capable ofproducing plenty for all, educating its youth and caring for its aged. We believe it coulddo this under Socialism. I saw great forests cut down and the denuded land left withblackened stumps; miles of top soil blown and washed away, and fertile fields became likea desert.I have seen textile workers who wove beautiful woolen fabricsshivering for lack of warm clothing, and coal miners living in cold shacks in companytowns, and steel towns that were armed camps. I saw men black-listed, driven fromtown to town, forced to change their names because they had dared to try to organize aunion.We will prove to you that it is not the Communists who haveadvocated or practiced force and violence but that it is the employing class which hasdone both throughout the history of my life in the American labor movement, like GeneralSherman Bell who said in Colorado during a miner&#146;s strike &#147;To Hell with habeascorpus; we&#146;ll give them post-mortems.&#148;We will prove to you that --****** *-- We will prove to you that it is nor we who flauntthe Constitution and the Bill of Rights, but that is has always been done by the employingclass. We will prove that we are fighting here for our constitutional and democraticrights, not to advocate force and violence, but to expose and stop its use against thepeople.We will demonstrate that in fighting for our rights, we believe weare defending the constitutional rights of all Americans. We believe we are acting as goodAmericans.Since six out of eleven of my writings in Political Affairs listedby the Government deal with what is called defense, I will prove to you that this has beena part of my life work since 1907 before there was a Communist Party.For example, I distributed thousands of copies of a famous documentin the &#145;20&#146;s called &#147;Illegal Practices of the Department of Justice,&#148;which is not among the Government&#146;s exhibits of old-time documents, but which I wouldgladly offer to the jury.It was signed by twelve of the most prominent lawyers ofthat period, including Professors Frankfurter and Chafee of Harvard and Francis FisherKane, who resigned his post as United States Attorney in Philadelphia in protest againstsuch proceedings.I early engaged in struggles to win free speech on the streets andin halls.This early identification with civil liberties led to my becoming a chartermember of the American Civil liberties Union in 1917, and later the organizer of theWorkers Defense Union, a delegate body from unions and fraternal organizations whichfurnished legal defense in political and labor prosecutions.We had plenty to do during the infamous 1920 Palmer Red Raids.We defended Socialist: I defended Socialists --****** *-- I worked for seven years in the unsuccessfulstruggles to save the lives of Sacco and Vanzetti. In the Government&#146;s list ofexhibits is an article I wrote in August, 1947 entitled &#147;Sacco and Vanzetti -- TwentyYears After,&#148; in which I pointed out the worldwide belief in their innocence.****** *Now I will show how and why I left the I.W.W. andjoined the Communist Party. This bears directly on the issue of forcible overthrowof the government that Mr. Lane spoke to you about this morning. After carefulreflection, it became clear to me that the I.W.W. was an anarcho-syndicalistorganization. The I.W.W. wanted to bring Socialism within Capitalism and then breakthrough the shell of Capitalism by the general strike and the seizing and possession ofindustry. Now, it was precisely this position that I rejected.I came to the conclusion that Socialism could be achieved, not byone splurge of violence, but by the persistent political activities of the workers and thepeople. And so in order to participate in political activities in the effort toachieve Socialism, I joined the Communist Party. In doing this, I got back into thelabor movement and stopped being what I then had decided was anarchistic.****** *As to the origin of the Communist Party, we willshow here that there developed within the Socialist Party an organized Left-wing movementuntil, by 1919, it was the majority of that party.At the Chicago convention of the Socialist Party a splitoccurred. The Left wing, ejected by the police, reorganized as the CommunistParty. The Left wing was the majority of the old Socialist Party.All of my Socialist friends and associates were Left-wingers.I was in great sympathy with them.By 1926, I had become convinced that the Communist Party was thelogical inheritor of all the best traditions, history and struggles of the older Socialistmovement and of the I.W.W., too. I was ready to join the party and gave anapplication to Charles Ruthenberg, then the secretary of the Communist Party, in 1926.Due to his sudden death a few weeks later during the most criticalperiod of my own illness, that application was apparently lost. Anyhow, it was neverpresented to the Party. I was ill of heart trouble in Portland, Oregon, at thattime.While there, I was in constant touch with my old friends, Ella ReeveBloor and Anita Whitney of California, both Communist leaders.Naturally, my heart and mind, although I was ill, were deeplyinvolved in the current political problems of the people, the menace of Fascism in Europe,the great struggles of the unemployment led by Communists Foster, Amter, Minor, Dennis andothers, and later the new unions which were present during the New Deal of PresidentRoosevelt.Miss Whitney brought me a Daily Worker in the fall of 1935 with aspeech by George Dimitroff, called &#147;The United Front Against War and Fascism,&#148;which the Government has stated it intends offering in evidence. This speech made adeep impression on me.We will show the character of Communist work in the struggle againstfascism in answer to this clarion call of Dimitroff, who died in 1949 as premier of hiscountry. We will show the background of this speech, which is essential in order foryou to understand its meaning and the intent with which I then joined the Communist Party.This was the time of the rise of fascism, which we will show seemedvery remote to most people in our country in the &#145;30&#146;s. People laughed at Hitlerand Mussolini as demagogues and mountebanks, but it caused great concern to the peoples ofEurope, especially to the Communists in those countries directly affected or threatened.George Dimitroff was a Bulgarian Communist who had been in exile inGermany and while there was framed in the infamous Reichstag fire case.****** *Dimitroff was freed. He took refuge in theSoviet Union, where he  delivered this speech in 1935 at the Congress of the CommunistInternational. It is an eloquent and dramatic appeal to fight fascism, which hedescribes as the most vicious enemy of mankind. It is addressed to Communistsespecially and other progressive people elsewhere, to put aside all immediate partisan orsectarian interest or differences or ultimate political aims to unite to stopfascism. We will prove that this is what is meant by &#147;united front.&#148;This policy brought Communists together with all other honest and patriotic people whowere determined to save their country from the ravages of fascism. We will show thatHank Forbes, one of our party organizers who might otherwise be here as a defendant, losthis life at the Anzio Beachhead in pursuance of that policy, as did hundreds of AmericanCommunists in World War II.I resolved when I read this powerful appeal, &#147;Here is where Ibelong. As soon as I am well I will again apply to join the CommunistParty.&#148; I did so. William Z. Foster, whom I first met in 1909 in theI.W.W., and Ella Reeve Bloor, whom I knew from the old Socialist Party, presented myapplication in the winter of 1936 and 1937. It was accepted and publicly announced in thepress.In my extreme youth I had affiliated myself with the nonpoliticalI.W.W.; in my maturity I came back into the working class political movement ofsocialism. This may seem a very lengthy introduction, but I have tried to drawconclusions from my biography on the issues in this case. I did not intend it to bepersonal, but and explanation of how and why I became a Communist. And I am anexample, not and exception.Now, as to my official position in the Communist Party, which Igladly and proudly acknowledge -- they are a matter of public record: in 1938 I became andam today a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party. The NationalCommittee was reduced in 1948 to 13. The other 12 members are William Z. Foster, ourchairman, who has been seriously ill for several years, and my dear comrades, the 11Communist leaders convicted under the Smith Act, which they challenged asunconstitutional. I have also been chairman of the Women&#146;s Committee of theCommunist Party since 1945, which the evidence will show carries on struggle for equalrights for women in shops, unions, and all organizations, even including our own partywhen necessary.My comrade, Claudia Jones, a defendant here, is the executivesecretary. We have worked together, spoken together, written, and helped organizewomen for full equality, both politically and economically, for the building of movementsfor peace, consumers&#146; councils, parent-teachers&#146; organizations, and similarorganizations, for the unity of Negro and white women, and to overcome the exploitation ofNegro women as workers, as women, as Negroes.Many articles which both of us have written on these subjects arefeatured in the Government&#146;s list of exhibits. We will demonstrate to you howconstructive and beneficial is the nature of our work among women, inspiring them togreater self-confidence, greater comradeship with one another, greater participation inpublic affairs. The evidence will show further that we have urged the organizationof women for political activity, not only on Election Day, but the year around, inhearings, delegations, petitions and statements to all legislative and public bodies onsuch issues as child care, better schools, better housing, a better standard of living,etc.We have written of the history of the women&#146;s movement in ourcountry, where every right we now enjoy has been won only by organized struggle -- theright of women to vote, to serve on juries, protective labor legislation for womenworkers, mothers&#146; pensions, and so forth.We have directed our sharpest criticism to the virtualdisfranchisement of the southern Negro women by force and violence and through the pooltax, discrimination against women in factories, lack of upbringing, etc.We have advocated socialism as a system of society best guaranteeingto women full equal rights in all spheres and insuring to them the possibility ofexercising these rights.I remind you again that we are not asking you to agree with us, butwill prove to you that we have not been advocating force and violence, but, rather, apeaceful, happy world.I have also been chairman of the defense committee of the Partysince 1948, when our leaders previously referred to were arrested. The evidence willshow that our duties, my duties, were to raise funds necessary for adequate legal defenseof our members who might be arrested under the Smith Act or held for deportation under theMcCarran Act. Individual Communists are not financially able to defendthemselves. These duties are ours. Our duties were to publicize the facts inthe case, since newspaper coverage is notoriously inadequate and invariably prejudiced, toorganized mass meetings, arrange tours for speakers, and generally call for public supportfor their defense.****** *In addition, the Government&#146;s list ofdocuments which they told us they would introduce in this case or indicated they wouldintroduce in this case, makes clear to you, will make clear to you, that I am a columnistof the Daily Worker. This is correct. For 15 years, form 1937 to date, I haveproduced at least two columns a week, besides many feature articles for the Sundaypaper. The Worker. These are my personal columns and are not submitted to theeditorial staff in advance. Praise or criticism comes from the readers. Someof my columns and articles are listed by the Government as Government&#146;s exhibits,which they intend to introduce. If they are to prove my official position in our Party ormy tours around the country or that I spoke in any specific places or that I invitedpeople to join the Communist Party, the Government need not waste its time. I do notdeny any of these things. The evidence will show that I asked people to joinit. I believe in the Party to which I belong. It is a legal Party in myestimation devoted to the best interest of the people, and I would not belong to it if Iwould hesitate to ask any honest persons to join me. Hundreds did so at myinvitation. I would be glad to make available to the jury at the appropriate timenot just a few articles carefully culled for the Government&#146;s purposes, but all ofthem dealing with a vast range of subjects.I will prove to you thereby that there is no advocacy of force andviolence in any one of them.****** *I have also written a dozen pamphlets during thepast period covered by the indictment.****** *One is called Stool Pigeon. Another The Plot to Gag America.The Government did not list them for your attention. Irecommend especially that you do read one of their listed documents if and when it ispresented -- the eloquent and able opening remarks of Eugene Dennis, General Secretary ofthe Communist Party, when he stood here, as I am standing now, defending himself beforeanother jury. I wrote an introduction to it. It is called The Case for theCommunist Party. The Government has indicated that it intends offering it inevidence, possibly for this reason. I am glad that the Government will make itavailable to you and would be happy to follow congressional example and ask that thisspeech of Eugene Dennis be considered an extension of my remarks.****** *I have handbills, advertisements and pressclipping relative to hundreds of public mass meetings arranged by the Communist Party atwhich I and other defendants have spoken in the past 15 years. We will prove thatnowhere has there been any advocacy of force and violence. The subject matter ofsuch meetings should interest this jury, I believe, however, as evidence of our intent.Take some at random: The Struggle Against the Taft-Hartley Law -- The Rights of the Negro People -- ****** *I and other defendants have spokenduring the period covered by the indictment and previously on the radio, especially inpolitical campaigns in support of Communist and other candidates, including Councilmen Cacchione and Davis, and for Simon W. Gerson, a defendant present here, when he was acandidate after Mr. Cacchione&#146;s sudden death.We will prove to you that the Communist Party, U.S.A.,is not, as the indictment sets forth, a society, group or assembly of persons but is alegitimate political party. It has nominated candidates for all public offices,including that of President. We will prove that defendants here on trial have beencandidates and won substantially high votes -- Perry, Gerson, Begun, Johnson, Weinstone andWeinstock.I ran with Mr. Benjamin J. Davis for Congress-at-largein 1942 and we each received over 50,000 votes.Our campaign slogan or program for victory was: &#147;Not an idle man. Not an idle machine. Not an idle acre.&#148;Mr. Gerson received 150,000 votes in Brooklyn in 1948. One of the defendants in the current Los Angeles Smith Act trial, aknown Communist, Miss Bernadette Doyle, received over 600,000 votes for a state-wideoffice as a peace candidate. Our evidence will prove how the Communist Party operatespolitically. We are a party of a new type in that we are not before the people justto capture their votes. We will prove that we are politically active the year round.We have attended public hearings as Communist spokesmen: for instance, I appeared with Mr.Gerson before the Senate Judiciary Committee to oppose the appointment of Tom Clarke tothe Supreme Court.If our Party along with other minority parties were not hampered byever-increasing electoral restrictions and barred from the ballot in some states, webelieve firmly we would win many more votes and elect candidates to Congress.Communists are represented in the Parliaments of all majornon-fascist countries in the world today.This is the arena where political views belong, in the marketplaceof public discussion, to be passed upon solely by the electorate of our country. The Government obviously intends to make much of the fact thatoccasionally we spoke in somebody&#146;s home to a selected group of people. Inreference to such house gatherings -- and some were purely social -- we will show that theseare some of the reasons:Sometimes it was because no hall could be rented and in smallone-industry towns, like steel, coal and textiles, people seen at a Communist meeting bycompany spies would lose their jobs and be black-listed, and even the unions would not beable to protect these members.Sometimes we held them in homes for the convenience of women whocould not attend otherwise. Sometimes it was for the protection of Negro people,especially in the South and border state areas, that the speaker goes to them rather thanexpecting them to come to the speaker. We will show that we consider it our duty asCommunists to protect workers, members and non-members alike, from harassment, loss ofjobs, threats of violence or FBI surveillance, and just because they come to ourmeetings. Wherever possible our meetings were open with the public and the pressinvited. Sometimes, unfortunately, Communists are driven to privacy as protectionagainst persecution.Criticism should not be directed to us but at those who create therepressive conditions which, we will prove, forces workers to choose between their jobsand their beliefs. We will prove, and I can assure you, that no member of our partybut what would be happy and willing to publicly declare his or her membership if the samerights and protection were accorded to us as to all others engaged in political activityin our country.The Government will also make much of schools, as Mr. Lane hasalready indicated, where Marxism-Leninism was taught.I gave lectures at certain schools in New York City, Pittsburgh,Philadelphia, Cleveland and at a national training school. My topics were either&#147;History of the Labor Movement&#148; or &#147;History of the Women&#146;s Movement inthe U.S.A.&#148; I have the outlines which I used in these courses which areanalytical and explanatory, and I will, because they are only brief -- I will offer them inevidence in this case.A course on the &#147;History of the American Labor Movement,&#148; delivered at the Jefferson School of New York, is presented here as the overt act of Mr.Louis Weinstock.This brings us to the skeleton upon which this case is built -- astrange new type of overt act, suggestive, if I may say so, of Nazi book-burning.They set forth --****** *They set forth, we believe, activities which arethe ordinary everyday acts of all organizations and individuals who seek to present theirviews in the marketplace of ideas.Of 29 overt acts, 11 are articles in the magazine Political Affairs.5 are Daily Worker articles.5, including mine, are public meetings.2 are committee meetings.2 are classes.One is leaving a building.One is mailing letters.One is writing a pamphlet.One is becoming a party organizer.The Government will attempt to clothe them, too. I presume, inthe so-called Aesopian language, or, no matter what we said, we really meant its opposite.It is quite a Houdini-like performance to say peace to a mass meeting of 10,000 people andmean war.Mr. Perry and I and our co-defendants will try, in the evidence wesubmit as this case progresses, to cut through the maze of what we considermisrepresentations in relation to Aesopian language, and to make it clear that what -- thatwe say what we mean and we mean what we say, and that the language of Marxism-Leninism isnot as mysterious or obscure as the Government attempts to make it sound.All sciences, even the law, have their own terminology, but like adoctor&#146;s prescription, this does not mean they are dishonest or misleading to thegeneral public. Not a single act of violence is alleged against any one of us.Not are there charges that I know of thus far that any of us collectively or individuallyadvocated the forceful overthrow of the United States Government.This science of Marxism-Leninism, which is expounded in the books asevidence had its origin over a century ago with two great political thinkers, Karl Marxand Frederick Engels. In a few words -- and there is always a danger ofover -- simplification of a scientific subject, they declared that what happens to humanityis not a matter of blind fate nor the will of great men, nor must it be accepted asirrevocable. They said mankind can find a scientific explanation for wars, famine,economic depression and poverty, and that mankind, especially the working class, can helpto change society, can alter and direct the course of history, can abolish these evils andinstitute a planned social order, based on the well-being of all. Out of their profoundanalysis of all human history, and especially of its present stage known as capitalism,they developed the system of scientific socialism which you will hear clarified by ourwitnesses.Today it has become a tremendous subject, too vast for any oneperson to fully explain, nor would the time allowed for a trial permit it. TheGovernment, I believe, will try to do the impossible, to compress over a century of thedevelopment of a great social science into the use of a few books and an infinitesimalpart of its application.These scientific theories were not fixed and final at the death ofMarx and Engels who never considered them a dogma. Like all sciences, they haveexpanded and have been modified by subsequent developments.Other students and writers took up where they left off, particularlyV. I. Lenin, a giant intellect and a great man who suffered exile and imprisonment underthe Russian Czar.He returned to his beloved country to lead the workers and peasantsto free themselves form Czarist tyranny and exploitation. Lenin enriched Marxism by hisstudies, especially his analyses of new social conditions brought about by the rise ofimperialism and the advent of socialism.Marxist-Leninist writings today fill thousands of books in all knownlanguages and would more than fill this courtroom from floor to ceiling. They arestudied by millions of people throughout the world, but we will prove to you that thesegreat beacon lights are not blueprints, are not hard-and-fast directive",,,82," Jimmy Carter - A Crisis of Confidence Speech - Jimmy CarterEnergy and the National Goals - A Crisis of Confidence delivered 15 July, 1979Video Purchase);  "", ""jimmycartercrisisofconfidence123."");   ; for flashOfficial President's Speaker Outline.doc[  fromaudio.]Good Evening:This a special night for me. Exactly three years ago, on July 15, 1976, I accepted the nomination of my party to run for President of the United States. I promised you a President who is not isolated from the people, who feels your pain, and who shares your dreams, and who draws his strength and his wisdom from you.During the past three years IåÕve spoken to you on many occasions about national concerns, the energy crisis, reorganizing the government, our nationåÕs economy, and issues of war and especially peace. But over those years the subjects of the speeches, the talks, and the press conferences have become increasingly narrow, focused more and more on what the isolated world of Washington thinks is important. Gradually, youåÕve heard more and more about what the government thinks or what the government should be doing and less and less about our nationåÕs hopes, our dreams, and our vision of the future.Ten days ago, I had planned to speak to you again about a very important subject -- energy. For the fifth time I would have described the urgency of the problem and laid out a series of legislative recommendations to the Congress. But as I was preparing to speak, I began to ask myself the same question that I now know has been troubling many of you: Why have we not been able to get together as a nation to resolve our serious energy problem?ItåÕs clear that the true problems of our nation are much deeper -- deeper than gasoline lines or energy shortages, deeper even than inflation or recession. And I realize more than ever that as President I need your help. So, I decided to reach out and to listen to the voices of America.I invited to Camp David people from almost every segment of our society -- business and labor, teachers and preachers, governors, mayors, and private citizens. And then I left Camp David to listen to other Americans, men and women like you. It has been an extraordinary ten days, and I want to share with you what IåÕve heard.First of all, I got a lot of personal advice. Let me quote a few of the typical comments that I wrote down.This from a southern governor: åÒMr. President, you are not leading this nation -- youåÕre just managing the government.åÓåÒYou donåÕt see the people enough anymore.åÓåÒSome of your Cabinet members donåÕt seem loyal. There is not enough discipline among your disciples.åÓåÒDonåÕt talk to us about politics or the mechanics of government, but about an understanding of our common good.åÓåÒMr. President, weåÕre in trouble. Talk to us about blood and sweat and tears.åÓåÒIf you lead, Mr. President, we will follow.åÓMany people talked about themselves and about the condition of our nation. This from a young woman in Pennsylvania: åÒI feel so far from government. I feel like ordinary people are excluded from political power.åÓAnd this from a young Chicano: åÒSome of us have suffered from recession all our lives.åÓåÒSome people have wasted energy, but others havenåÕt had anything to waste.åÓAnd this from a religious leader: åÒNo material shortage can touch the important things like GodåÕs love for us or our love for one another.åÓAnd I like this one particularly from a black woman who happens to be the mayor of a small Mississippi town: åÒThe big shots are not the only ones who are important. Remember, you canåÕt sell anything on Wall Street unless someone digs it up somewhere else first.åÓThis kind of summarized a lot of other statements: åÒMr. President, we are confronted with a moral and a spiritual crisis.åÓSeveral of our discussions were on energy, and I have a notebook full of comments and advice. IåÕll read just a few.åÒWe canåÕt go on consuming forty percent more energy then we produce. When we import oil we are also importing inflation plus unemployment.åÓåÒWeåÕve got to use what we have. The Middle East has only five percent of the worldåÕs energy, but the United States has twenty-four percent.åÓAnd this is one of the most vivid statements: åÒOur neck is stretched over the fence and OPEC has a knife.åÓåÒThere will be other cartels and other shortages. American wisdom and courage right now can set a path to follow in the future.åÓThis was a good one: åÒBe bold, Mr. President. We may make mistakes, but we are ready to experiment.åÓAnd this one from a labor leader got to the heart of it: åÒThe real issue is freedom. We must deal with the energy problem on a war footing.åÓAnd the last that IåÕll read: åÒWhen we enter the moral equivalent of war, Mr. President, donåÕt issue us BB guns.åÓThese ten days confirmed my belief in the decency and the strength and the wisdom of the American people, but it also bore out some of my longstanding concerns about our nationåÕs underlying problems.I know, of course, being President, that government actions and legislation can be very important. ThatåÕs why IåÕve worked hard to put my campaign promises into law, and I have to admit, with just mixed success. But after listening to the American people, I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world canåÕt fix whatåÕs wrong with America. So, I want to speak to you first tonight about a subject even more serious than energy or inflation. I want to talk to you right now about a fundamental threat to American democracy.I do not mean our political and civil liberties. They will endure. And I do not refer to the outward strength of America, a nation that is at peace tonight everywhere in the world, with unmatched economic power and military might.The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways.It is a crisis of confidence.It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation.The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America. The confidence that we have always had as a people is not simply some romantic dream or a proverb in a dusty book that we read just on the Fourth of July. It is the idea which founded our nation and has guided our development as a people. Confidence in the future has supported everything else -- public institutions and private enterprise, our own families, and the very Constitution of the United States. Confidence has defined our course and has served as a link between generations. WeåÕve always believed in something called progress. WeåÕve always had a faith that the days of our children would be better than our own.Our people are losing that faith, not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy. As a people we know our past and we are proud of it. Our progress has been part of the living history of America, even the world. We always believed that we were part of a great movement of humanity itself called democracy, involved in the search for freedom; and that belief has always strengthened us in our purpose. But just as we are losing our confidence in the future, we are also beginning to close the door on our past.In a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close-knit communities, and our faith in God, too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns. But weåÕve discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning. WeåÕve learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose.The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us. For the first time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years. Two-thirds of our people do not even vote. The productivity of American workers is actually dropping, and the willingness of Americans to save for the future has fallen below that of all other people in the Western world.As you know, there is a growing disrespect for government and for churches and for schools, the news media, and other institutions. This is not a message of happiness or reassurance, but it is the truth and it is a warning.These changes did not happen overnight. TheyåÕve come upon us gradually over the last generation, years that were filled with shocks and tragedy.We were sure that ours was a nation of the ballot, not the bullet, until the murders of John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. We were taught that our armies were always invincible and our causes were always just, only to suffer the agony of Vietnam. We respected the Presidency as a place of honor until the shock of Watergate.We remember when the phrase åÒsound as a dollaråÓ was an expression of absolute dependability, until ten years of inflation began to shrink our dollar and our savings. We believed that our nationåÕs resources were limitless until 1973 when we had to face a growing dependence on foreign oil.These wounds are still very deep. They have never been healed.Looking for a way out of this crisis, our people have turned to the Federal Government and found it isolated from the mainstream of our nationåÕs life. Washington, D.C., has become an island. The gap between our citizens and our government has never been so wide. The people are looking for honest answers, not easy answers; clear leadership, not false claims and evasiveness and politics as usual.What you see too often in Washington and elsewhere around the country is a system of government that seems incapable of action. You see a Congress twisted and pulled in every direction by hundreds of well-financed and powerful special interests.You see every extreme position defended to the last vote, almost to the last breath by one unyielding group or another. You often see a balanced and a fair approach that demands sacrifice, a little sacrifice from everyone, abandoned like an orphan without support and without friends.Often you see paralysis and stagnation and drift. You donåÕt like it, and neither do I. What can we do?First of all, we must face the truth, and then we can change our course. We simply must have faith in each other, faith in our ability to govern ourselves, and faith in the future of this nation. Restoring that faith and that confidence to America is now the most important task we face. It is a true challenge of this generation of Americans.One of the visitors to Camp David last week put it this way: åÒWeåÕve got to stop crying and start sweating, stop talking and start walking, stop cursing and start praying. The strength we need will not come from the White House, but from every house in America.åÓWe know the strength of America. We are strong. We can regain our unity. We can regain our confidence. We are the heirs of generations who survived threats much more powerful and awesome than those that challenge us now. Our fathers and mothers were strong men and women who shaped a new society during the Great Depression, who fought world wars and who carved out a new charter of peace for the world.We ourselves are the same Americans who just ten years ago put a man on the moon. We are the generation that dedicated our society to the pursuit of human rights and equality. And we are the generation that will win the war on the energy problem and in that process, rebuild the unity and confidence of America.We are at a turning point in our history. There are two paths to choose. One is a path IåÕve warned about tonight, the path that leads to fragmentation and self-interest. Down that road lies a mistaken idea of freedom, the right to grasp for ourselves some advantage over others. That path would be one of constant conflict between narrow interests ending in chaos and immobility. It is a certain route to failure.All the traditions of our past, all the lessons of our heritage, all the promises of our future point to another path -- the path of common purpose and the restoration of American values. That path leads to true freedom for our nation and ourselves. We can take the first steps down that path as we begin to solve our energy problem.Energy will be the immediate test of our ability to unite this nation, and it can also be the standard around which we rally. On the battlefield of energy we can win for our nation a new confidence, and we can seize control again of our common destiny. In little more than two decades weåÕve gone from a position of energy independence to one in which almost half the oil we use comes from foreign countries, at prices that are going through the roof. Our excessive dependence on OPEC has already taken a tremendous toll on our economy and our people. This is the direct cause of the long lines which have made millions of you spend aggravating hours waiting for gasoline. ItåÕs a cause of the increased inflation and unemployment that we now face. This intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very security of our nation.The energy crisis is real. It is worldwide. It is a clear and present danger to our nation. These are facts and we simply must face them.What I have to say to you now about energy is simple and vitally important.Point one: I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the United States. Beginning this moment, this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977-- never. From now on, every new addition to our demand for energy will be met from our own production and our own conservation. The generation-long growth in our dependence on foreign oil will be stopped dead in its tracks right now and then reversed as we move through the 1980s, for I am tonight setting the further goal of cutting our dependence on foreign oil by one-half by the end of the next decade -- a saving of over four and a half million barrels of imported oil per day.Point two: To ensure that we meet these targets, I will use my presidential authority to set import quotas. IåÕm announcing tonight that for 1979 and 1980, I will forbid the entry into this country of one drop of foreign oil more than these goals allow. These quotas will ensure a reduction in imports even below the ambitious levels we set at the recent Tokyo summit.Point three: To give us energy security, I am asking for the most massive peacetime commitment of funds and resources in our nationåÕs history to develop AmericaåÕs own alternative sources of fuel -- from coal, from oil shale, from plant products for gasohol, from unconventional gas, from the sun.I propose the creation of an energy security corporation to lead this effort to replace two and a half million barrels of imported oil per day by 1990. The corporation will issue up to five billion dollars in energy bonds, and I especially want them to be in small denominations so average Americans can invest directly in AmericaåÕs energy security.Just as a similar synthetic rubber corporation helped us win World War II, so will we mobilize American determination and ability to win the energy war. Moreover, I will soon submit legislation to Congress calling for the creation of this nationåÕs first solar bank which will help us achieve the crucial goal of twenty percent of our energy coming from solar power by the year 2000.These efforts will cost money, a lot of money, and that is why Congress must enact the windfall profits tax without delay. It will be money well spent. Unlike the billions of dollars that we ship to foreign countries to pay for foreign oil, these funds will be paid by Americans, to Americans. These will go to fight, not to increase, inflation and unemployment.Point four: IåÕm asking Congress to mandate, to require as a matter of law, that our nationåÕs utility companies cut their massive use of oil by fifty percent within the next decade and switch to other fuels, especially coal, our most abundant energy source.Point five: To make absolutely certain that nothing stands in the way of achieving these goals, I will urge Congress to create an energy mobilization board which, like the War Production Board in World War II, will have the responsibility and authority to cut through the red tape, the delays, and the endless roadblocks to completing key energy projects.We will protect our environment. But when this nation critically needs a refinery or a pipeline, we will  build it.Point six: IåÕm proposing a bold conservation program to involve every state, county, and city and every average American in our energy battle. This effort will permit you to build conservation into your homes and your lives at a cost you can afford.I ask Congress to give me authority for mandatory conservation and for standby gasoline rationing. To further conserve energy, IåÕm proposing tonight an extra ten billion dollars over the next decade to strengthen our public transportation systems. And IåÕm asking you for your good and for your nationåÕs security to take no unnecessary trips, to use carpools or public transportation whenever you can, to park your car one extra day per week, to obey the speed limit, and to set your thermostats to save fuel. Every act of energy conservation like this is more than just common sense, I tell you it is an act of patriotism.Our nation must be fair to the poorest among us, so we will increase aid to needy Americans to cope with rising energy prices. We often think of conservation only in terms of sacrifice. In fact, it is the most painless and immediate ways of rebuilding our nationåÕs strength. Every gallon of oil each one of us saves is a new form of production. It gives us more freedom, more confidence, that much more control over our own lives. So, the solution of our energy crisis can also help us to conquer the crisis of the spirit in our country. It can rekindle our sense of unity, our confidence in the future, and give our nation and all of us individually a new sense of purpose.You know we can do it. We have the natural resources. We have more oil in our shale alone than several Saudi Arabias. We have more coal than any nation on earth. We have the worldåÕs highest level of technology. We have the most skilled work force, with innovative genius, and I firmly believe that we have the national will to win this war.I do not promise you that this struggle for freedom will be easy. I do not promise a quick way out of our nationåÕs problems, when the truth is that the only way out is an all-out effort. What I do promise you is that I will lead our fight, and I will enforce fairness in our struggle, and I will ensure honesty. And above all, I will act.We can manage the short-term shortages more effectively, and we will; but there are no short-term solutions to our long-range problems. There is simply no way to avoid sacrifice.Twelve hours from now I will speak again in Kansas City, to expand and to explain further our energy program. Just as the search for solutions to our energy shortages has now led us to a new awareness of our nationåÕs deeper problems, so our willingness to work for those solutions in energy can strengthen us to attack those deeper problems.I will continue to travel this country, to hear the people of America. You can help me to develop a national agenda for the 1980s. I will listen; and I will act. We will act together.These were the promises I made three years ago, and I intend to keep them.Little by little we can and we must rebuild our confidence. We can spend until we empty our treasuries, and we may summon all the wonders of science. But we can succeed only if we tap our greatest resources -- AmericaåÕs people, AmericaåÕs values, and AmericaåÕs confidence.I have seen the strength of America in the inexhaustible resources of our people. In the days to come, let us renew that strength in the struggle for an energy-secure nation.In closing, let me say this: I will do my best, but I will not do it alone. Let your voice be heard. Whenever you have a chance, say something good about our country. With GodåÕs help and for the sake of our nation, it is time for us to join hands in America. Let us commit ourselves together to a rebirth of the American spirit. Working together with our common faith we cannot fail.Thank you and good night.  Book/CDs by Michael E.

ButI have to tell you that Hillary and I also come as parents, as husband and wife, as peoplewho were your neighbors for some of the best years of our lives.Today our nation joins with you in grief. We mourn with you. Weshare your hope against hope that some may still survive. We thank all those who haveworked so heroically to save lives and to solve this crime -- those here in Oklahoma andthose who are all across this great land, and many who left their own lives to come hereto work hand in hand with you. We pledge to do all we can to help you heal the injured, to rebuildthis city, and to bring to justice those who did this evil.This terrible sin took the lives of our American family, innocentchildren in that building, only because their parents were trying to be good parents aswell as good workers; citizens in the building going about their daily business; and manythere who served the rest of us -- who worked to help the elderly and the disabled, whoworked to support our farmers and our veterans, who worked to enforce our laws and toprotect us. Let us say clearly, they served us well, and we are grateful.But for so many of you they were also neighbors and friends. You sawthem at church or the PTA meetings, at the civic clubs, at the ball park. You know them inways that all the rest of America could not. And to all the members of the families herepresent who have suffered loss, though we share your grief, your pain is unimaginable, andwe know that. We cannot undo it. That is God's work.Our words seem small beside the loss you have endured. But I found afew I wanted to share today. I've received a lot of letters in these last terrible days.One stood out because it came from a young widow and a mother of three whose own husbandwas murdered with over 200 other Americans when Pan Am 103 was shot down. Here is whatthat woman said I should say to you today:The anger you feel is valid, but you must not allow yourselves to beconsumed by it. The hurt you feel must not be allowed to turn into hate, but instead intothe search for justice. The loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives. Instead, youmust try to pay tribute to your loved ones by continuing to do all the things they leftundone, thus ensuring they did not die in vain.Wise words from one who also knows.You have lost too much, but you have not lost everything. And youhave certainly not lost America, for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as ittakes.If ever we needed evidence of that, I could only recall the words ofGovernor and Mrs. Keating:If anybody thinks that Americans are mostly mean and selfish,they ought to come to Oklahoma. If anybody thinks Americans have lost thecapacity for love and caring and courage, they ought to come to Oklahoma.To all my fellow Americans beyond this hall, I say, one thing we owethose who have sacrificed is the duty to purge ourselves of the dark forces which gaverise to this evil. They are forces that threaten our common peace, our freedom, our way oflife. Let us teach our children that the God of comfort is also the God ofrighteousness: Those who trouble their own house will inherit the wind.1 Justice willprevail. Let us let our own children know that we will stand against theforces of fear. When there is talk of hatred, let us stand up and talk against it. Whenthere is talk of violence, let us stand up and talk against it. In the face of death, letus honor life. As St. Paul admonished us, Let us not be overcome by evil, but overcomeevil with good.2Yesterday, Hillary and I had the privilege of speaking with somechildren of other federal employees -- children like those who were lost here. And onelittle girl said something we will never forget. She said, We should all plant a tree inmemory of the children. So this morning before we got on the plane to come here, at theWhite House, we planted that tree in honor of the children of Oklahoma. It was a dogwood with its wonderful spring flower and its deep,enduring roots. It embodies the lesson of the Psalms -- that the life of a good person islike a tree whose leaf does not wither.å_My fellow Americans, a tree takes a long time to grow, and woundstake a long time to heal. But we must begin. Those who are lost now belong to God. Someday we will be with them. But until that happens, their legacy must be our lives.Thank you all, and God bless you.1 Proverbs 11:29 -- He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind, and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart. (NKJV)2 Romans 12:21 -- Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. (NIV)3 Psalms 1:3 -- Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. (NIV)See Also:Late Draft of the Speech w/ Edits.pdfAudio, Image and Late Draft Document Source:William J.

",,,84," Shirley Chisholm - For the Equal Rights Amendment (Aug 10, 1970)Shirley Anita St. Hill ChisholmFor the EqualRights Amendment delivered 10 Aug 1970, Washington, DC. for flashMr. Speaker, House Joint Resolution 264, before us today, whichprovides for equality under the law for both men and women, represents one of the mostclear-cut opportunities we are likely to have to declare our faith in the principles thatshaped our Constitution. It provides a legal basis for attack on the most subtle, mostpervasive, and most institutionalized form of prejudice that exists.  Discriminationagainst women, solely on the basis of their sex, is so widespread that is seems to manypersons normal, natural and right.Legal expression of prejudice on the grounds of religious orpolitical belief has become a minor problem in our society. Prejudice on the basis of raceis, at least, under systematic attack. Their is reason for optimism that it will start todie with the present, older generation. It is time we act to assure full equality ofopportunity to those citizens who, although in a majority, suffer the restrictions thatare commonly imposed on minorities, to women.The argument that this amendment will not solve the problem of sexdiscrimination is not relevant. If the argument were used against a civil rights bill, asit has been used in the past, the prejudice that lies behind it would be embarrassing. Ofcourse laws will not eliminate prejudice from the hearts of human beings. But that is noreason to allow prejudice to continue to be enshrined in our laws -- to perpetuateinjustice through inaction.The amendment is necessary to clarify countless ambiguities andinconsistencies in our legal system. For instance, the Constitution guarantees due processof law, in the 5th and 14th amendments. But the applicability of due process of sexdistinctions is not clear. Women are excluded from some State colleges and universities.In some States, restrictions are placed on a married woman who engages in an independentbusiness. Women may not be chosen for some juries. Women even receive heavier criminalpenalties than men who commit the same crime. What would the legal effects of the equalrights amendment really be? The equal rights amendment would govern only the relationshipbetween the State and its citizens -- not relationships between private citizens. Theamendment would be largely self-executing, that is, and Federal or State laws in conflictwould be ineffective one year after date of ratification without further action by theCongress or State legislatures.Opponents of the amendment claim its ratification would throw thelaw into a state of confusion and would result in much litigation to establish itsmeaning. This objection overlooks the influence of legislative history in determiningintent and the recent activities of many groups preparing for legislative changes in thisdirection.State labor laws applying only to women, such as those limitinghours of work and weights to be lifted would become inoperative unless the legislatureamended them to apply to men. As of early 1970 most States would have some laws that would be affected. However, changes are being made so rapidly as a result of title VII ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is likely that by the time the equal rights amendmentwould become effective; no confliction State laws would remain.In any event, there has for years been great controversy as to theusefulness to women of these State labor laws. There has never been any doubt that theyworked a hardship on women who need or want to work overtime and on women who need or wantbetter paying jobs, and there has been no persuasive evidence as to how many women benefitfrom the archaic policy of the laws. After the Delaware hours law was repealed in 1966,there were no complaints from women to any of the State agencies that might have beenapproached.Jury service laws not making women equally liable for jury servicewould have been revised. The selective service law would have to include women, but womenwould not be required to serve in the Armed Forces where they are not fitted any more thanmen are required to serve. Military service, while a great responsibility, is not withoutbenefits, particularly for young men with limited education or training.Since October 1966, 246,000 young men who did not meet the normalmental or physical requirements have been given opportunities for training and correctingphysical problems. This opportunity is not open to their sisters. Only girls who havecompleted high school and meet high standards on the educational test can volunteer.Ratification of the amendment would not permit application of higher standards to women.Survivorship benefits would be available to husbands of femaleworkers on the same basis as to wives of male workers. The Social Security Act and thecivil service and military service retirement acts are in conflict. Public schools anduniversities could not be limited to one sex and could not apply different admissionstandards to men and women. Laws requiring longer prison sentences for women than menwould be invalid, and equal opportunities for rehabilitation and vocational training wouldhave to be provided in public correctional institutions. Different ages of majority basedon sex would have to be harmonized. Federal, State, and other governmental bodies would beobligated to follow nondiscriminatory practices in all aspects of employment, includingpublic school teachers and State university and college faculties.What would be the economic effects of the equal rights amendment? Directeconomic effects would be minor. If any labor laws applying only to women still remained,their amendment or repeal would provide opportunity for women in better-paying jobs inmanufacturing. More opportunities in public vocational and graduate schools for womenwould also tend to open up opportunities in better jobs for women.Indirect effects could be much greater. The focusing of publicattention on the gross legal, economic, and social discrimination against women byhearings and debates in the Federal and State legislatures would result in changes inattitude of parents, educators, and employers that would bring about substantial economicchanges in the long run.Sex prejudice cuts both ways. Men are oppressed by the requirementsof the Selective Service Act, by enforced legal guardianship of minors, and by alimonylaws. Each sex, I believe, should be liable when necessary to serve and defend thiscountry. Each has a responsibility for the support of children.There are objections raised to wiping out laws protecting womenworkers. No one would condone exploitation. But what does sex have to do with it. Workingconditions and hours that are harmful to women are harmful to men; wages that are unfairfor women are unfair for men. Laws setting employment limitations on the basis of sex areirrational, and the proof of this is their inconsistency from State to State. The physicalcharacteristics of men and women are not fixed, but cover two wide spans that have a greatdeal of overlap. It is obvious, I think, that a robust woman could be more fit forphysical labor than a weak man. The choice of occupation would be determined by individualcapabilities, and the rewards for equal works should be equal.This is what it comes down to: artificial distinctions betweenpersons must be wiped out of the law. Legal discrimination between the sexes is, in almostevery instance, founded on outmoded views of society and the pre-scientific beliefs aboutpsychology and physiology. It is time to sweep away these relics of the past and setfurther generations free of them.Federal agencies and institutions responsible for the enforcement ofequal opportunity laws need the authority of a Constitutional amendment. The 1964 CivilRights Act and the 1963 Equal Pay Act are not enough; they are limited in theircoverage -- for instance, one excludes teachers, and the other leaves out administrative andprofessional women. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has not proven to be anadequate device, with its power limited to investigation, conciliation, and recommendationto the Justice Department. In its cases involving sexual discrimination, it has failed inmore than one-half. The Justice Department has been even less effective. It hasintervened in only one case involving discrimination on the basis of sex, and this was ona procedural point. In a second case, in which both sexual and racial discrimination werealleged, the racial bias charge was given far greater weight.Evidence of discrimination on the basis of sex should hardly have tobe cited here. It is in the Labor Department&#146;s employment and salary figures foranyone who is still in doubt. Its elimination will involve so many changes in our Stateand Federal laws that, without the authority and impetus of this proposed amendment, itwill perhaps take another 194 years. We cannot be parties to continuing a delay. The timeis clearly now to put this House on record for the fullest expression of that equality ofopportunity which our founding fathers professed. They professed it, but they did notassure it to their daughters, as they tried to do for their sons.The Constitution they wrote was designed to protect the rights ofwhite, male citizens. As there were no black Founding Fathers, there were no foundingmothers -- a great pity, on both counts. It is not too late to complete the work theyleft undone. Today, here, we should start to do so.In closing I would like to make one point. Social and psychologicaleffects will be initially more important than legal or economic results. As Leo Kanowitzhas pointed out:Rules of law that treatof the sexes per see inevitably produce far-reaching effects upon social, psychological and economic aspectsof male-female relations beyond the limited confines of legislative chambers andcourtrooms. As long as organized legal systems, at once the most respected and mostfeared of social institutions, continue to differentiate sharply, in treatment or inwords, between men and women on the basis of irrelevant and artificially createddistinctions, the likelihood of men and women coming to regard one another primarily asfellow human beings and only secondarily as representatives of another sex will continueto be remote. When men and women are prevented from recognizing oneanother&#146;s essential humanity by sexual prejudices, nourished by legal as well as socialinstitutions, society as a whole remains less than it could otherwise become.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,85," Ronald Reagan -- Remarks at the BrandenburgGateRonald ReaganRemarks at the BrandenburgGate delivered 12 June 1987, West BerlinVideo Purchase);  "", ""ronaldreaganbrandenburggate."");   ; for flash (2)] Thank you. Thank you, very much. Chancellor Kohl, Governing Mayor Diepgen, ladies and gentlemen:Twenty four years ago, President John F. Kennedy visited Berlin, and speaking to thepeople of this city and the world at the city hall. Well since then two otherpresidents have come, each in his turn to Berlin. And today, I, myself, make mysecond visit to your city.We come to Berlin, we American Presidents, because it's our duty to speak in this place of freedom. But I must confess, weåÕre drawn here by other things as well; by the feeling of history in this city -- more than 500 years older than our own nation; by the beauty of the Grunewald and the Tiergarten; most of all, by your courage and determination. Perhaps the composer, Paul Linke, understood something about American Presidents. You see, like so many Presidents before me, I come here today because wherever I go, whatever I do: åÒIch hab noch einen Koffer in BerlinåÓ [I still have a suitcase in Berlin.]Ourgathering today is being broadcast throughout Western Europe and North America.I understand that it is being seen and heard as well in the East. To thoselistening throughout Eastern Europe, I extend my warmest greetings and the good will of theAmerican people. To those listening in East Berlin, a special word: AlthoughI cannot be with you, I address my remarks to you just as surely as to thosestanding here before me. For I join you, as I join your fellow countrymen in theWest, in this firm, this unalterable belief: Es gibt nur ein Berlin. [There isonly one Berlin.]Behind me stands a wall thatencircles the free sectors of this city, part of a vast system of barriers that divides the entire continent of Europe. From the Baltic South, those barriers cutacross Germany in a gash of barbed wire, concrete, dog runs, and guard towers.Farther south, there may be no visible, no obvious wall. But there remain armedguards and checkpoints all the same -- still a restriction on the right to travel,still an instrument to impose upon ordinary men and women the will ofa totalitarian state.Yet, it is here in Berlin where the wall emerges mostclearly; here, cutting across your city, where the news photo and the televisionscreen have imprinted this brutal division of a continent upon the mind of theworld. Standing before the Brandenburg Gate, every man is a German separatedfrom his fellow men.Every man is a Berliner, forced to look upon a scar.President Von WeizsÌ_cker has said, The German question is open as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed. Well today -- today I say: As long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind.Yet, I do not come here to lament. For I find in Berlin a message of hope, even in the shadow of this wall, a message of triumph.In this season of spring in 1945, the people of Berlin emerged from their air-raid shelters to find devastation. Thousands of miles away, the people of the United States reached out to help. And in 1947 Secretary of State -- as you've been told -- George Marshall announced the creation of what would become known as theMarshall Plan. Speaking precisely 40 years ago this month, he said: Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos.In the Reichstag a few moments ago, I saw a display commemorating this 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan. I was struck by a sign -- the sign on a burnt-out, gutted structure that was being rebuilt. I understand that Berliners of my own generation can remember seeing signs like it dotted throughout the western sectors of the city. The sign read simply: The Marshall Plan is helping here to strengthen the free world. A strong, free world in the West -- that dream became real. Japan rose from ruin to become an economic giant. Italy, France, Belgium -- virtually every nation in Western Europe saw political and economic rebirth; the European Community was founded.In West Germany and here in Berlin, there took place an economic miracle, the Wirtschaftswunder. Adenauer, Erhard, Reuter, and other leaders understood the practical importance of liberty -- that just as truth can flourish only when the journalist is given freedom of speech, so prosperity can come about only when the farmer and businessman enjoy economic freedom. The German leaders -- the German leaders reduced tariffs, expanded free trade, lowered taxes. From 1950 to 1960 alone, the standard of living in West Germany and Berlin doubled.Where four decades ago there was rubble, today in West Berlin there is the greatest industrial output of any city in Germany: busy office blocks, fine homes and apartments, proud avenues, and the spreading lawns of parkland. Where a city's culture seemed to have been destroyed, today there are two great universities, orchestras and an opera, countless theaters, and museums. Where there was want, today there's abundance -- food, clothing, automobiles -- the wonderful goods of the Kudamm.å_ From devastation, from utter ruin, you Berliners have, in freedom, rebuilt a city that once again ranks as one of the greatest on earth. Now the Soviets may have had other plans. But my friends, there were a few things the Soviets didn't count on: Berliner Herz, Berliner Humor, ja, und Berliner Schnauze. [Berliner heart, Berliner humor, yes, and a Berliner Schnauze.å_]In the 1950s -- In the 1950s Khrushchev predicted: We will bury you. But in the West today, we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well-being unprecedented in all human history. In the Communist world, we see failure, technological backwardness, declining standards of health, even want of the most basic kind -- too little food. Even today, the Soviet Union still cannot feed itself. After these four decades, then, there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion: Freedom leads to prosperity. Freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity and peace. Freedom is the victor.And now -- now the Soviets themselves may, in a limited way, be coming to understand the importance of freedom. We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of reform and openness. Some political prisoners have been released. Certain foreign news broadcasts are no longer being jammed. Some economic enterprises have been permitted to operate with greater freedom from state control.Are these the beginnings of profound changes in the Soviet state? Or are they token gestures intended to raise false hopes in the West, or to strengthen the Soviet system without changing it? We welcome change and openness; for we believe that freedom and security go together, that the advance of human liberty -- the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace.There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace. General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate.Mr. Gorbachev -- Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!I understand the fear of war and the pain of division that afflict this continent, and I pledge to you my country's efforts to help overcome these burdens. To be sure, we in the West must resist Soviet expansion. So, we must maintain defenses of unassailable strength. Yet we seek peace; so we must strive to reduce arms on both sides.Beginning 10 years ago, the Soviets challenged the Western alliance with a grave new threat, hundreds of new and more deadly SS-20 nuclear missiles capable of striking every capital in Europe. The Western alliance responded by committing itself to a counter-deployment (unless the Soviets agreed to negotiate a better solution) -- namely, the elimination of such weapons on both sides. For many months, the Soviets refused to bargain in earnestness. As the alliance, in turn, prepared to go forward with its counter-deployment, there were difficult days, days of protests like those during my 1982 visit to this city; and the Soviets later walked away from the table.But through it all, the alliance held firm. And I invite those who protested then -- I invite those who protest today -- to mark this fact: Because we remained strong, the Soviets came back to the table. Because we remained strong, today we have within reach the possibility, not merely of limiting the growth of arms, but of eliminating, for the first time, an entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth.As I speak, NATO ministers are meeting in Iceland to review the progress of our proposals for eliminating these weapons. At the talks in Geneva, we have also proposed deep cuts in strategic offensive weapons. And the Western allies have likewise made far-reaching proposals to reduce the danger of conventional war and to place a total ban on chemical weapons. While we pursue these arms reductions, I pledge to you that we will maintain the capacity to deter Soviet aggression at any level at which it might occur. And in cooperation with many of our allies, the United States is pursuing the Strategic Defense Initiative -- research to base deterrence not on the threat of offensive retaliation, but on defenses that truly defend; on systems, in short, that will not target populations, but shield them. By these means we seek to increase the safety of Europe and all the world. But we must remember a crucial fact: East and West do not mistrust each other because we are armed; we are armed because we mistrust each other. And our differences are not about weapons but about liberty. WhenPresident Kennedy spoke at the City Hall those 24 years ago, freedom was encircled; Berlin was under siege. And today, despite all the pressures upon this city, Berlin stands secure in its liberty. And freedom itself is transforming the globe.In the Philippines, in South and Central America, democracy has been given a rebirth. Throughout the Pacific, free markets are working miracle after miracle of economic growth. In the industrialized nations, a technological revolution is taking place, a revolution marked by rapid, dramatic advances in computers and telecommunications. In Europe, only one nation and those it controls refuse to join the community of freedom. Yet in this age of redoubled economic growth, of information and innovation, the Soviet Union faces a choice: It must make fundamental changes, or it will become obsolete.Today, thus, represents a moment of hope. We in the West stand ready to cooperate with the East to promote true openness, to break down barriers that separate people, to create a safer, freer world. And surely there is no better place than Berlin, the meeting place of East and West, to make a start. Free people of Berlin: Today, as in the past, the United States stands for the strict observance and full implementation of all parts of theFour Power Agreement of 1971. Let us use this occasion, the 750th anniversary of this city, to usher in a new era, to seek a still fuller, richer life for the Berlin of the future. Together, let us maintain and develop the ties between the Federal Republic and the Western sectors of Berlin, which is permitted by the 1971 agreement. And I invite Mr. Gorbachev: Let us work to bring the Eastern and Western parts of the city closer together, so that all the inhabitants of all Berlin can enjoy the benefits that come with life in one of the great cities of the world.To open Berlin still further to all Europe, East and West, let us expand the vital air access to this city, finding ways of making commercial air service to Berlin more convenient, more comfortable, and more economical. We look to the day when West Berlin can become one of the chief aviation hubs in all central Europe. With -- With our French -- With our French and British partners, the United States is prepared to help bring international meetings to Berlin. It would be only fitting for Berlin to serve as the site of United Nations meetings, or world conferences on human rights and arms control, or other issues that call for international cooperation.There is no better way to establish hope for the future than to enlighten young minds, and we would be honored to sponsor summer youth exchanges, cultural events, and other programs for young Berliners from the East. Our French and British friends, I'm certain, will do the same. And it's my hope that an authority can be found in East Berlin to sponsor visits from young people of the Western sectors. One final proposal, one close to my heart: Sport represents a source of enjoyment and ennoblement, and you may have noted that the Republic of Korea -- South Korea -- has offered to permit certain events of the 1988 Olympics to take place in the North. International sports competitions of all kinds could take place in both parts of this city. And what better way to demonstrate to the world the openness of this city than to offer in some future year to hold the Olympic games here in Berlin, East and West.In these four decades, as I have said, you Berliners have built a great city. You've done so in spite of threats -- the Soviet attempts to impose the East-mark, the blockade. Today the city thrives in spite of the challenges implicit in the very presence of this wall. What keeps you here? Certainly there's a great deal to be said for your fortitude, for your defiant courage. But I believe there's something deeper, something that involves Berlin's whole look and feel and way of life -- not mere sentiment. No one could live long in Berlin without being completely disabused of illusions. Something, instead, that has seen the difficulties of life in Berlin but chose to accept them, that continues to build this good and proud city in contrast to a surrounding totalitarian presence, that refuses to release human energies or aspirations, something that speaks with a powerful voice of affirmation, that says yes to this city, yes to the future, yes to freedom. In a word, I would submit that what keeps you in Berlin -- is love.Love both profound and abiding.Perhaps this gets to the root of the matter, to the most fundamental distinction of all between East and West. The totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship. The totalitarian world finds even symbols of love and of worship an affront. Years ago, before the East Germans began rebuilding their churches, they erected a secular structure: the television tower at Alexander Platz. Virtually ever since, the authorities have been working to correct what they view as the tower's one major flaw: treating the glass sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind. Yet even today when the sun strikes that sphere, that sphere that towers over all Berlin, the light makes the sign of the cross. There in Berlin, like the city itself, symbols of love, symbols of worship, cannot be suppressed.As I looked out a moment ago from the Reichstag, that embodiment of German unity, I noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the wall, perhaps by a young Berliner (quote):This wall will fall. Beliefs become reality.Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall, for it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom.And I would like, before I close, to say one word. I have read, and I have been questioned since I've been here about certain demonstrations against my coming. And I would like to say just one thing, and to those who demonstrate so. I wonder if they have ever asked themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek, no one would ever be able to do what they're doing again.Thank you and God bless you all. Thank you.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Interestingly enough, the sound and choice of words among these folks is slightly more rude as compared to similar expressions found in other regions n Germany. Schnauze is the German word for mouth of dogs and is comparable to the word snout.

He was finally free, butthere was no joy in his heart. He thought there never would be again. Liberateda day earlier by American soldiers, he remembers their rage at what theysaw. And even if he lives to be a very old man, he will always be gratefulto them for that rage, and also for their compassion. Though he did notunderstand their language, their eyes told him what he needed to know --that they, too, would remember, and bear witness. And now, I stand before you, Mr. President -- Commander-in-Chief ofthe army that freed me, and tens of thousands of others -- and I am filledwith a profound and abiding gratitude to the American people. Gratitudeis a word that I cherish. Gratitude is what defines the humanity of thehuman being. And I am grateful to you, Hillary, or Mrs. Clinton, forwhat you said, and for what you are doing for children in the world, forthe homeless, for the victims of injustice, the victims of destiny andsociety. And I thank all of you for being here. We are on the threshold of a new century, a new millennium. What willthe legacy of this vanishing century be? How will it be remembered in thenew millennium? Surely it will be judged, and judged severely, in bothmoral and metaphysical terms. These failures have cast a dark shadow overhumanity: two World Wars, countless civil wars, the senseless chain ofassassinations (Gandhi, the Kennedys, Martin Luther King, Sadat, Rabin), bloodbaths in Cambodia and Algeria, India and Pakistan, Ireland andRwanda, Eritrea and Ethiopia, Sarajevo and Kosovo; the inhumanity in thegulag and the tragedy of Hiroshima. And, on a different level, of course,Auschwitz and Treblinka. So much violence; so much indifference. What is indifference? Etymologically, the word means ""no difference.""A strange and unnatural state in which the lines blur between light anddarkness, dusk and dawn, crime and punishment, cruelty and compassion,good and evil. What are its courses and inescapable consequences? Is ita philosophy? Is there a philosophy of indifference conceivable? Can onepossibly view indifference as a virtue? Is it necessary at times to practiceit simply to keep one's sanity, live normally, enjoy a fine meal and aglass of wine, as the world around us experiences harrowing upheavals? Of course, indifference can be tempting -- more than that, seductive.It is so much easier to look away from victims. It is so much easier toavoid such rude interruptions to our work, our dreams, our hopes. It is,after all, awkward, troublesome, to be involved in another person's painand despair. Yet, for the person who is indifferent, his or her neighborare of no consequence. And, therefore, their lives are meaningless. Theirhidden or even visible anguish is of no interest. Indifference reducesthe Other to an abstraction. Over there, behind the black gates of Auschwitz, the most tragic ofall prisoners were the ""Muselmanner,"" as they were called. Wrapped in theirtorn blankets, they would sit or lie on the ground, staring vacantly intospace, unaware of who or where they were -- strangers to their surroundings.They no longer felt pain, hunger, thirst. They feared nothing. They feltnothing. They were dead and did not know it. Rooted in our tradition, some of us felt that to be abandoned by humanitythen was not the ultimate. We felt that to be abandoned by God was worsethan to be punished by Him. Better an unjust God than an indifferent one.For us to be ignored by God was a harsher punishment than to be a victimof His anger. Man can live far from God -- not outside God. God is whereverwe are. Even in suffering? Even in suffering. In a way, to be indifferent to that suffering is what makes the humanbeing inhuman. Indifference, after all, is more dangerous than anger andhatred. Anger can at times be creative. One writes a great poem, a greatsymphony. One does something special for the sake of humanity because oneis angry at the injustice that one witnesses. But indifference is nevercreative. Even hatred at times may elicit a response. You fight it. Youdenounce it. You disarm it. Indifference elicits no response. Indifference is not a response. Indifferenceis not a beginning; it is an end. And, therefore, indifference is alwaysthe friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor -- never his victim,whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten. The political prisonerin his cell, the hungry children, the homeless refugees -- not to respondto their plight, not to relieve their solitude by offering them a sparkof hope is to exile them from human memory. And in denying their humanity,we betray our own. Indifference, then, is not only a sin, it is a punishment.And this is one of the most important lessons of this outgoing century'swide-ranging experiments in good and evil. In the place that I come from, society was composed of three simplecategories: the killers, the victims, and the bystanders. During the darkestof times, inside the ghettoes and death camps -- and I'm glad that Mrs.Clinton mentioned that we are now commemorating that event, that period,that we are now in the Days of Remembrance -- but then, we felt abandoned,forgotten. All of us did. And our only miserable consolation was that we believed that Auschwitzand Treblinka were closely guarded secrets; that the leaders of the freeworld did not know what was going on behind those black gates and barbedwire; that they had no knowledge of the war against the Jews that Hitler'sarmies and their accomplices waged as part of the war against the Allies.If they knew, we thought, surely those leaders would have moved heavenand earth to intervene. They would have spoken out with great outrage andconviction. They would have bombed the railways leading to Birkenau, justthe railways, just once. And now we knew, we learned, we discovered that the Pentagon knew, theState Department knew. And the illustrious occupant of the White Housethen, who was a great leader -- and I say it with some anguish and pain,because, today is exactly 54 years marking his death -- Franklin DelanoRoosevelt died on April the 12th, 1945. So he is very much present to meand to us. No doubt, he was a great leader. He mobilized the American peopleand the world, going into battle, bringing hundreds and thousands of valiantand brave soldiers in America to fight fascism, to fight dictatorship,to fight Hitler. And so many of the young people fell in battle. And, nevertheless,his image in Jewish history -- I must say it -- his image in Jewish historyis flawed.The depressing tale of   the St. Louis is a case in point. Sixty yearsago, its human cargo -- nearly 1,000 Jews -- was turned back to Nazi Germany.And that happened after the  Kristallnacht, after the first state sponsoredpogrom, with hundreds of Jewish shops destroyed, synagogues burned, thousandsof people put in concentration camps. And that ship, which was alreadyin the shores of the United States, was sent back. I don't understand.Roosevelt was a good man, with a heart. He understood those who neededhelp. Why didn't he allow these refugees to disembark? A thousand people-- in America, the great country, the greatest democracy, the most generousof all new nations in modern history. What happened? I don't understand.Why the indifference, on the highest level, to the suffering of the victims?  But then, there were human beings who were sensitive to our tragedy.Those non-Jews, those Christians, that we call the ""Righteous Gentiles,""whose selfless acts of heroism saved the honor of their faith. Why werethey so few? Why was there a greater effort to save SS murderers afterthe war than to save their victims during the war? Why did some of America'slargest corporations continue to do business with Hitler's Germany until1942? It has been suggested, and it was documented, that theWehrmachtcould not have conducted its invasion of France without oil obtained fromAmerican sources. How is one to explain their indifference? And yet, my friends, good things have also happened in this traumaticcentury: the defeat of Nazism, the collapse of communism, the rebirth ofIsrael on its ancestral soil, the demise of apartheid, Israel's peace treatywith Egypt, the peace accord in Ireland. And let us remember the meeting,filled with drama and emotion, between Rabin and Arafat that you, Mr. President,convened in this very place. I was here and I will never forget it. And then, of course, the joint decision of the United States and NATOto intervene in Kosovo and save those victims, those refugees, those whowere uprooted by a man, whom I believe that because of his crimes, shouldbe charged with crimes against humanity. But this time, the world was not silent. This time, we do respond. Thistime, we intervene. Does it mean that we have learned from the past? Does it mean that societyhas changed? Has the human being become less indifferent and more human?Have we really learned from our experiences? Are we less insensitive tothe plight of victims of ethnic cleansing and other forms of injusticesin places near and far? Is today's justified intervention in Kosovo, ledby you, Mr. President, a lasting warning that never again will the deportation,the terrorization of children and their parents, be allowed anywhere inthe world? Will it discourage other dictators in other lands to do thesame? What about the children? Oh, we see them on television, we read aboutthem in the papers, and we do so with a broken heart. Their fate is alwaysthe most tragic, inevitably. When adults wage war, children perish. Wesee their faces, their eyes. Do we hear their pleas? Do we feel their pain,their agony? Every minute one of them dies of disease, violence, famine. Some of them -- so many of them -- could be saved. And so, once again, I think of the young Jewish boy from the CarpathianMountains. He has accompanied the old man I have become throughout theseyears of quest and struggle. And together we walk towards the new millennium,carried by profound fear and extraordinary hope.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Nixon delivered on September 8, 1974, Washington D.C.    );  "", ""geraldfordnixonpardon."");   ;  click for pdf click for flash (2)]*Ladies and gentlemen: I have come to a decision which I felt I shouldtell you and all of my fellow American citizens, as soon as I was certain in my own mindand in my own conscience that it is the right thing to do. *I have learned already in thisoffice that the difficult decisions always come to this desk. I must admit that many ofthem do not look at all the same as the hypothetical questions that I have answered freelyand perhaps too fast on previous occasions.My customary policy is to try and get all the facts and to considerthe opinions of my countrymen and to take counsel with my most valued friends. But theseseldom agree, and in the end, the decision is mine. To procrastinate, to agonize, and towait for a more favorable turn of events that may never come or more compelling externalpressures that may as well be wrong as right, is itself a decision of sorts and a weak andpotentially dangerous course for a President to follow.I have promised to uphold the Constitution, to do what is right asGod gives me to see the right, and to do the very best that I can for America. I haveasked your help and your prayers, not only when I became President but many times since.The Constitution is the supreme law of our land, and it governs our actions as citizens.Only the laws of God, which govern our consciences, are superior to it.As we are a nation under God, so I am sworn to uphold our laws withthe help of God. And I have sought such guidance and searched my own conscience withspecial diligence to determine the right thing for me to do with respect to my predecessorin this place, Richard Nixon, and his loyal wife and family. Theirs is an American tragedyin which we all -- all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must writethe end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must.There are no historic or legal precedents to which I can turn inthis matter, none that precisely fit the circumstances of a private citizen who hasresigned the Presidency of the United States. But it is common knowledge that seriousallegations and accusations hang like a sword over our former President's head,threatening his health as he tries to reshape his life, a great part of which was spent inthe service of this country and by the mandate of its people.After years of bitter controversy and divisive national debate, Ihave been advised, and I am compelled to conclude that many months and perhaps more yearswill have to pass before Richard Nixon could obtain a fair trial by jury in anyjurisdiction of the United States under governing decisions of the Supreme Court. I deeplybelieve in equal justice for all Americans, whatever their station or former station. Thelaw, whether human or divine, is no respecter of persons; but the law is a respecter ofreality.The facts, as I see them, are that a former President of the UnitedStates, instead of enjoying equal treatment with any other citizen accused of violatingthe law, would be cruelly and excessively penalized either in preserving the presumptionof his innocence or in obtaining a speedy determination of his guilt in order to repay alegal debt to society. During this long period of delay and potential litigation, uglypassions would again be aroused. And our people would again be polarized in theiropinions. And the credibility of our free institutions of government would again bechallenged at home and abroad. In the end, the courts might well hold that Richard Nixonhad been denied due process, and the verdict of history would even more be inconclusivewith respect to those charges arising out of the period of his Presidency, of which I ampresently aware.But it is not the ultimate fate of Richard Nixon that most concernsme, though surely it deeply troubles every decent and every compassionate person. Myconcern is the immediate future of this great country. In this, I dare not depend upon mypersonal sympathy as a long-time friend of the former President, nor my professionaljudgment as a lawyer, and I do not.As President, my primary concern must always be the greatest good ofall the people of the United States whose servant I am. As a man, my first considerationis to be true to my own convictions and my own conscience. My conscience tells me clearlyand certainly that I cannot prolong the bad dreams that continue to reopen a chapter thatis closed. My conscience tells me that only I, as President, have the constitutional powerto firmly shut and seal this book. My conscience tells me it is my duty, not merely toproclaim domestic tranquility but to use every means that I have to insure it.I do believe that the buck stops here, that I cannot rely uponpublic opinion polls to tell me what is right.I do believe that right makes might and that if I am wrong, 10angels swearing I was right would make no difference.I do believe, with all my heart and mind and spirit, that I, not asPresident but as a humble servant of God, will receive justice without mercy if I fail toshow mercy.Finally, I feel that Richard Nixon and his loved ones have sufferedenough and will continue to suffer, no matter what I do, no matter what we, as a great andgood nation, can do together to make his goal of peace come true.Now, therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States,pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article II, Section 2,of the Constitution, have granted and by these presents do grant a full,free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against theUnited States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may havecommitted or taken part in during the period from July 20,1969 through August 9, 1974.*In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day ofSeptember, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-four,and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundredand ninety-ninth.*Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,88," Woodrow Wilson -- Address in Support of the League of NationsWoodrow WilsonThe League of Nations delivered 1919 for flashIt gives me pleasure to add to this formal reading of the result of our labors that the character of the discussion which occurred at the sittings of the commission was not only of the most constructive but of the most encouraging sort. It was obvious throughout our discussions that, although there were subjects upon which there were individual differences of judgment with regard to the method by which our objects should be obtained, there was practically at no point any serious differences of opinion or motive as to the objects which we were seeking.Indeed, while these debates were not made the opportunity for the expression of enthusiasm and sentiments, I think the other members of the commission will agree with me that there was an undertone of high respect and of enthusiasm for the thing we were trying to do which was heartening throughout everything.Because we felt that in a way this conference did entrust into us the expression of one of its highest and most important purposes, to see to it that the concord of the world in the future with regard to the objects of justice should not be subject to doubt or uncertainty; that the cooperation of the great body of nations should be assured in the maintenance of peace upon terms of honor and of international obligations.The compulsion of that task was constantly upon us, and at no point was there shown the slightest desire to do anything but suggest the best means to accomplish that great object. There is very great significance, therefore, in the fact that the result was reached unanimously.Fourteen nations were represented, among them all of those powers which for convenience we have called the Great Powers, and among the rest a representation of the greatest variety of circumstances and interests. So that I think we are justified in saying that the significance of the result, therefore, has the deepest of all meanings, the union of wills in a common purpose, a union of wills which cannot be resisted and which, I dare say, no nation will run the risk of attempting to resist.Now, as to the character of the document. While it has consumed some time to read this document, I think you will see at once that it is very simple, and in nothing so simple as in the structure which it suggests for a league of nations, a body of delegates, an executive council, and a permanent secretariat.When it came to the question of determining the character of the representation in the Body of Delegates, we were all aware of a feeling which is current throughout the world.Inasmuch as I am stating it in the presence of the official representatives of the various governments here present, including myself, I may say that there is a universal feeling that the world cannot rest satisfied with merely official guidance. There has reached us through many channels the feeling that if the deliberating body of the League of Nations was merely to be a body of officials representing the various governments, the peoples of the world would not be sure that some of the mistakes which preoccupied officials had admittedly made might not be repeated.It was impossible to conceive a method or an assembly so large and various as to be really representative of the great body of the peoples of the world, because, as I roughly reckon it, we represent as we sit around this table more than 1.2 billion people.You cannot have a representative assembly of 1.2 billion people, but if you leave it to each government to have, if it pleases, one or two or three representatives, though only with a single vote, it may vary its representation from time to time, not only, but it may (originate) the choice of its several representatives [wireless here unintelligible.Therefore we thought that this was a proper and a very prudent concession to the practically universal opinion of plain men everywhere that they wanted the door left open to a variety of representation, instead of being confined to a single official body with which they could or might not find themselves in sympathy.And you will notice that this body has unlimited rights of discussion. I mean of discussion of anything that falls within the field of international relations--and that it is especially agreed that war or international misunderstandings or anything that may lead to friction or trouble is everybody's business, because it may affect the peace of the world.And in order to safeguard the popular power so far as we could of this representative body, it is provided, you will notice, that when a subject is submitted it is not to arbitration but to discussion by the Executive Council; it can, upon the initiative of either of the parties to the dispute, be drawn out of the Executive Council on the larger form of the general Body of Delegates, because through this instrument we are depending primarily and chiefly upon one great force, and this is the moral force of the public opinion of the world--the pleasing and clarifying and compelling influences of publicity--so that intrigues can no longer have their coverts; so that designs that are sinister can at anytime be drawn into the open, so that those things that are destroyed by the light may be promptly destroyed by the overwhelming light of the universal expression of the condemnation of the world.Armed force is in the background in this program; but it is in the background, and, if the moral force of the world will not suffice, the physical force of the world shall. But that is the last resort, because this is intended as a constitution of peace, not as a league of war.The simplicity of the document seems to me to be one of its chief virtues, because, speaking for myself, I was unable to see the variety of circumstances with which this League would have to deal. I was unable, therefore, to plan all the machinery that might be necessary to meet the differing and unexpected contingencies. Therefore, I should say of this document that it is not a straitjacket but a vehicle of life.A living thing is born, and we must see to it what clothes we put on it. It is not a vehicle of power, but a vehicle in which power may be varied at the discretion of those who exercise it and in accordance with the changing circumstances of the time. And yet, while it is elastic, while it is general in its terms, it is definite in the one thing that we were called upon to make definite.It is a definite guaranty of peace. It is a definite guaranty by word against aggression. It is a definite guaranty against the things which have just come near bringing the whole structure of civilization into ruin.Its purposes do not for a moment lie vague. Its purposes are declared, and its powers are unmistakable. It is not in contemplation that this should be merely a league to secure the peace of the world. it is a league which can be used for cooperation in any international matter.That is the significance of the provision introduced concerning labor. There are many ameliorations of labor conditions which can be effected by conference and discussion. I anticipate that there will be a very great usefulness in the Bureau of Labor which it is contemplated shall be set up by the League.Men and women and children who work have been in the background through long ages and sometimes seemed to be forgotten, while governments have had their watchful and suspicious eyes upon the maneuvers of one another, while the thought of statesmen has been about structural action and the larger transactions of commerce and of finance.Now, if I may believe the picture which I see, there comes into the foreground the great body of the laboring people of the world, the men and women and children upon whom the great burden of sustaining the world must from day to day fall, whether we wish it to do so or not; people who go to bed tired and wake up without the stimulation of lively hope. These people will be drawn into the field of international consultation and help, and will be among the wards of the combined governments of the world. This is, I take leave to say, a very great step in advance in the mere conception of that.Then, as you will notice, there is an imperative article concerning the publicity of all international agreements. Henceforth no member of the League can call any agreement valid which it has not registered with the secretary general, in whose office, of course, it will be subject to the examination of any body representing a member of the League. And the duty is laid upon the secretary general to earliest possible time.I suppose most persons who have not been conversant with the business of foreign affairs do not realize how many hundreds of these agreements are made in a single year, and how difficult it might be to publish the more unimportant of them immediately. How uninteresting it would be to most of the world to publish them immediately, but even they must be published just as soon as it is possible for the secretary general to publish them.There has been no greater advance than this, gentlemen. If you look back upon the history of the world you will see how helpless peoples have too often been a prey to powers that had no conscience in the matter. It has been one of the many distressing revelations of recent years that the great power which has just been, happily, defeated put intolerable burdens and injustices upon the helpless people of some of the colonies which it annexed to itself; that its interest was rather their extermination than their development; that the desire was to possess their land for European purposes, and not to enjoy their confidence in order that mankind might be lifted in these places to the next higher level.Now, the world, expressing its conscience in law, says there is an end of that, that our consciences shall be settled to this thing. States will be picked out which have already shown that they can exercise a conscience in this matter, and under their tutelage the helpless peoples of the world will come into a new light and into a new hope.Research Note 1: May not be the address that the authors of the Top 100 list had in mind.Research Note 2: Thanks to Guodong Jia of the School of Foreign Language, Peoples Uni of China, Beijing for bringing this speech to my attention.Copyright Status:Text and Image = Public domain.Top 100 American SpeechesOnline Speech Bankå© Copyright 2001-Present.

The greatest leader of our time has been struck down by  the foulest deed of our time. Today, John Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on in the  immortal words and works that he left behind. He lives on in the mind and  memories of mankind. He lives on in the hearts of his countrymen. No words are  sad enough to express our sense of loss. No words are strong enough to express  our determination to continue the forward thrust of America that he began.   The dream of conquering the vastness of space, thedream of partnership across the Atlantic -- and across the Pacific as well-- the dream of a Peace Corps in less developed nations, the dream ofeducation for all of our children, the dream of jobs for all who seek themand need them, the dream of care for our elderly, the dream of an all-outattack on mental illness, and above all, the dream of equal rights for allAmericans, whatever their race or color. These and other American dreamshave been vitalized by his drive and by his dedication. And now the ideasand the ideals which he so nobly represented must and will be translatedinto effective action.Under John Kennedy&#39;sleadership, this nation has demonstrated that it has the courage to seekpeace, and it has the fortitude to risk war. We have proved that we are agood and reliable friend to those who seek peace and freedom. We haveshown that we can also be a formidable foe to those who reject the path ofpeace and those who seek to impose upon us or our allies the yoke oftyranny. This nation will keep its commitments from South Vietnam to WestBerlin. We will be unceasing in the search for peace, resourceful in ourpursuit of areas of agreement -- even with those with whom we differ --and generous and loyal to those who join with us in common cause.   In this age when there can be no losers in peace and novictors in war, we must recognize the obligation to match nationalstrength with national restraint. We must be prepared at one and the sametime for both the confrontation of power and the limitation of power. Wemust be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the commoninterest. This is the path that we shall continue to pursue. Those whotest our courage will find it strong, and those who seek our friendshipwill find it honorable. We will demonstrate anew that the strong can bejust in the use of strength, and the just can be strong in the defense ofjustice.And let all know we will extend nospecial privilege and impose no persecution. We will carry on the fightagainst poverty, and misery, and disease, and ignorance, in other landsand in our own. We will serve all the nation, not one section or onesector, or one group, but all Americans.  Theseare the United States: A united people with a united purpose.   Our American unity does not depend upon unanimity. Wehave differences; but now, as in the past, we can derive from thosedifferences strength, not weakness, wisdom, not despair. Both as a peopleand a government, we can unite upon a program, a program which is wise andjust, enlightened and constructive.For 32years Capitol Hill has been my home. I have shared many moments of pridewith you, pride in the ability of the Congress of the United States toact, to meet any crisis, to distill from our differences strong programsof national action. An assassin&#39;s bullet has thrust upon me the awesomeburden of the Presidency. I am here today to say I need your help. Icannot bear this burden alone. I need the help of all Americans, and allAmerica.This nation has experienced aprofound shock, and in this critical moment, it is our duty, yours andmine, as the Government of the United States, to do away with uncertaintyand doubt and delay, and to show that we are capable of decisive action;that from the brutal loss of our leader we will derive not weakness, butstrength; that we can and will act and act now.   From this chamber of representative government, let allthe world know and none misunderstand that I rededicate this Government tothe unswerving support of the United Nations, to the honorable anddetermined execution of our commitments to our allies, to the maintenanceof military strength second to none, to the defense of the strength andthe stability of the dollar, to the expansion of our foreign trade, to thereinforcement of our programs of mutual assistance and cooperation in Asiaand Africa, and to our Alliance for Progress in this hemisphere.   On the 20th day of January, in 19 and 61, John F.Kennedy told his countrymen that our national work would not be finishedin the first thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, noreven perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But, he said, let usbegin. Today in this moment of new resolve, Iwould say to all my fellow Americans, let us continue.  This is our challenge -- not to hesitate, not to pause,  not to turn about and linger over this evil moment, but to continue on our  course so that we may fulfill the destiny that history has set for us.   Our most immediate tasks are here on this Hill. First,no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor PresidentKennedy&#39;s memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil RightsBill for which he fought so long. We have talked long enough in thiscountry about equal rights. We have talked for a hundred years or more. Itis time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books oflaw. I urge you again, as I did in 19 and 57 and again in 19 and 60, toenact a civil rights law so that we can move forward to eliminate fromthis nation every trace of discrimination and oppression that is basedupon race or color. There could be no greater source of strength to thisnation both at home and abroad.And second, noact of ours could more fittingly continue the work of President Kennedythan the early passage of the tax bill for which he fought all this longyear. This is a bill designed to increase our national income and Federalrevenues, and to provide insurance against recession. That bill, if passedwithout delay, means more security for those now working, more jobs forthose now without them, and more incentive for our economy.   In short, this is no time for delay. It is a time foraction -- strong, forward-looking action on the pending education bills tohelp bring the light of learning to every home and hamlet in America;strong, forward-looking action on youth employment opportunities; strong,forward-looking action on the pending foreign aid bill, making clear thatwe are not forfeiting our responsibilities to this hemisphere or to theworld, nor erasing Executive flexibility in the conduct of our foreignaffairs; and strong, prompt, and forward-looking action on the remainingappropriation bills.In this new spirit ofaction, the Congress can expect the full cooperation and support of theexecutive branch. And, in particular, I pledge that the expenditures ofyour Government will be administered with the utmost thrift and frugality.I will insist that the Government get a dollar&#39;s value for a dollar spent.The Government will set an example of prudence and economy.   This does not mean that we will not meet our unfilledneeds or that we will not honor our commitments. We will do both.   As one who has long served in both Houses of theCongress, I firmly believe in the independence and the integrity of thelegislative branch. And I promise you that I shall always respect this. Itis deep in the marrow of my bones. With equal firmness, I believe in thecapacity and I believe in the ability of the Congress, despite thedivisions of opinions which characterize our nation, to act -- to actwisely, to act vigorously, to act speedily when the need arises.   The need is here. The need is now. I ask your help.   We meet in grief, but let us also meet in reneweddedication and renewed vigor. Let us meet in action, in tolerance, and inmutual understanding.John Kennedy&#39;s deathcommands what his life conveyed -- that America must move forward.The time has come for Americans of all races and creedsand political beliefs to understand and to respect one another. So let usput an end to the teaching and the preaching of hate and evil andviolence. Let us turn away from the fanatics of the far left and the farright, from the apostles of bitterness and bigotry, from those defiant oflaw, and those who pour venom into our nation&#39;s bloodstream.   I profoundly hope that the tragedy and the torment ofthese terrible days will bind us together in new fellowship, making us onepeople in our hour of sorrow.So let us herehighly resolve that John Fitzgerald Kennedy did not live or die in vain.   And on this Thanksgiving eve, as we gather together toask the Lord&#39;s blessing, and give Him our thanks, let us unite in thosefamiliar and cherished words:America,America,God shed His grace on thee,And crown thy goodWithbrotherhoodFrom sea to shining sea.Book/CDs by Michael E.

Senator McCarthy: Not exactly, Mr. Chairman. But in view of Mr. Welch's requestthat the information be given once we know of anyone who might be performingany work for the Communist Party, I think we should tell him that he has in his lawfirm a young man named Fisher whom he recommended, incidentally, to dothe work on this Committee, who has been, for a number of years, a member of an organizationwhich is named, oh, years and years ago, as the legal bulwark of the Communist Party, an organization which always springs to the defense of anyonewho dares to expose Communists.Knowing that, Mr. Welch, I just felt that I had a duty to respond toyour urgent request that ""before sundown,"" when we know of anyoneserving the Communist cause we let the agency know.Now, we're now lettingyou know that your man did belong to this organization for either threeor four years, belonged to it long after he was out of law school.And I have hesitated bringing that up, but I have been rather bored withyour phony requests to Mr. Cohn here, that he, personally, get everyCommunist out of Government before sundown. Whether you knew that he was a member of that Communist organizationor not, I don't know.I assume you did not, Mr. Welch, because Iget the impression that while you are quite an actor, you play for a laugh,I don't think you have any conception of the danger of the Communist Party.I don't think you, yourself, would ever knowingly aid the Communist cause.I think you're unknowingly aiding it when you try to burlesque thishearing in which we're attempting to bring out the facts. Mr. Welch: Mr. Chairman....Senator Mundt: The Chair may say that he has no recognition or no memory ofMr. Welch recommending either Mr. Fisher or anybody else as counsel forthis Committee.Senator McCarthy: I refer to the record, Mr. Chairman...to the news story onthat.Mr. Welch: Mr. Chairman.Under these circumstances, I must myself havesomething approaching a personal privilege. Senator Mundt: You may have, sir --Mr. Welch: Senator McCarthy, I did not know, Senator -- Senator, sometimesyou say may I have your attention --Senator McCarthy: I'm listening....Mr. Welch: May I have your attention? Senator McCarthy: I can listen with one ear and talk with -- Mr. Welch: No, this time, sir, I want you to listen with both.Senator McCarthy, I think until this moment --Senator McCarthy: -- Good. Just a minute. Jim, Jim, will you getthe news story to the effect that this man belongs to the -- to this Communistfront organization....Mr. Welch: I will tell you that he belonged to it.Senator McCarthy: Jim, will you get the citation, one of the citations showingthat this was the legal arm of the Communist Party, and the length of timethat he belonged, and the fact that he was recommended by Mr. Welch. Ithink that should be in the record.... Mr. Welch: Senator, you won't need anything in the record when I finishtelling you this.Until this moment, Senator, I think I never reallygauged your cruelty, or your recklessness. Fred Fisher is a young man whowent to the Harvard Law School and came into my firm and is starting whatlooks to be a brilliant career with us. When I decided to work for thisCommittee, I asked Jim St. Clair, who sits on my right, to be my first assistant.I said to Jim, ""Pick somebody in the firm to work under you that you wouldlike."" He chose Fred Fisher, and they came down on an afternoon plane.That night, when we had taken a little stab at trying to see what the caseis about, Fred Fisher and Jim St. Clair and I went to dinner together.I then said to these two young men, ""Boys, I don't know anything aboutyou, except I've always liked you, but if there's anything funny in thelife of either one of you that would hurt anybody in this case, you speakup quick.""And Fred Fisher said, ""Mr. Welch, when I was in the law school, andfor a period of months after, I belonged to the Lawyers' Guild,"" as youhave suggested, Senator. He went on to say, ""I am Secretary of the YoungRepublican's League in Newton with the son of [the] Massachusetts governor,and I have the respect and admiration of my community, and I'm sure I have the respect and admirationof the twenty-five lawyers or so in Hale &amp; Dorr."" And I said, ""Fred,I just don't think I'm going to ask you to work on the case.If Ido, one of these days that will come out, and go over national television,and it will just hurt like the dickens."" And so, Senator, I asked him togo back to Boston. Little did I dream you could be so reckless and so cruelas to do an injury to that lad. It is, I regret to say, equally true thatI fear he shall always bear a scar needlessly inflicted by you.Ifit were in my power to forgive you for your reckless cruelty, Iwould do so. I like to think I'm a gentle man, but your forgiveness willhave to come from someone other than me.SenatorMcCarthy:Mr. Chairman, may I say that Mr. Welch talks about thisbeing cruel and reckless.He was just baiting.He has beenbaiting Mr. Cohn here for hours, requesting that Mr. Cohn before sundownget out of any department of the government anyone who is serving the Communistcause. Now, I just give this man's record and I want to say, Mr. Welch,that it had been labeled long before he became a member, as early as 1944--Mr. Welch:Senator, may we not drop this?We know he belongedto the Lawyers' Guild. SenatorMcCarthy: Let me finish....Mr. Welch: And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me.Idid you, I think, no personal injury, Mr. Cohn?Mr. Cohn: No, sir. Mr. Welch:I meant to do you no personal injury.Mr. Cohn: No, sir.Mr. Welch: And if I did, I beg your pardon.Let us not assassinatethis lad further, Senator.Senator McCarthy: Let's, let's --Mr. Welch: You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir, at longlast?Have you left no sense of decency?Senator McCarthy: I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch.Mr. Welch: I'll say it hurts!Senator McCarthy: Mr. Chairman, as point of personal privilege, I'd like tofinish this.Mr. Welch: Senator, I think it hurts you, too, sir.Senator McCarthy:I'd like to finish this.I know Mr. Cohn wouldrather not have me go into this. I intend to, however, and Mr. Welch talksabout any sense of decency. I have heard you and everyone else talk so much about laying the truthupon the table.But when I heard the completely phony Mr. Welch,I've been listening now for a long time, he's saying, now before sundown youmust get these people out of government. So I just want you to have itvery clear, very clear that you were not so serious about that when youtried to recommend this man for this Committee.Mr. Welch: Mr. McCarthy, I will not discuss this further with you.You have sat within six feet of me and could ask -- could have asked me aboutFred Fisher. You have seen fit to bring it out, and if there isa God in heaven, it will do neither you nor your cause any good.I will not discuss it further.I will not ask, Mr. Cohn,anymore witnesses. You, Mr. Chairman, may, if you will, call the next witness.Book/CDs by Michael E.

",,,91," On the Adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human RightsEleanor RooseveltOn the Adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights delivered 9 December 1948 in Paris, FranceVideo Purchase);  "", ""eroosevelthumanrights."");   ; for flash (2)]Mr. President, fellow delegates:The long and meticulous study and debate of which this UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights is the product means that it reflects the composite views ofthe many men and governments who have contributed to its formulation. Not every man norevery government can have what he wants in a document of this kind. There are of courseparticular provisions in the Declaration before us with which we are not fully satisfied.I have no doubt this is true of other delegations, and it would still be true if we continued our labors over many years. Taken as a whole the Delegation ofthe United States believes that this is a good document -- even a great document -- and wepropose to give it our full support. The position of the United States on the variousparts of the Declaration is a matter of record in the Third Committee. I shall not burdenthe Assembly, and particularly my colleagues of the Third Committee, with a restatement ofthat position here.I should like to comment briefly on the amendments proposed by the Soviet delegation. The language of these amendments has been dressed up somewhat, but the substance is the same as the amendments which were offered by the Soviet delegation in committee and rejected after exhaustive discussion. Substantially the same amendments have been previously considered and rejected in the Human Rights Commission. We in the United States admire those who fight for their convictions, and the Soviet delegation has fought for their convictions. But in the older democracies we have learned that sometimes we bow to the will of the majority. In doing that, we do not give up our convictions. We continue sometimes to persuade, and eventually we may be successful. But we know that we have to work together and we have to progress. So, we believe that when we have made a good fight, and the majority is against us, it is perhaps better tactics to try to cooperate. I feel bound to say that I think perhaps it is somewhat of an imposition on this Assembly to have these amendments offered again here, and I am confident that they will be rejected without debate. The first two paragraphs of the amendment to article 3 deal with the question of minorities, which committee 3 decided required further study, and has recommended, in a separate resolution, their reference to the Economic and Social Council and the Human Rights Commission. As set out in the Soviet amendment, this provision clearly states group, and not individual, rights. The Soviet amendment to article 20 is obviously a very restrictive statement of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. It sets up standards which would enable any state practically to deny all freedom of opinion and expression without violating the article. It introduces the terms democratic view, democratic systems, democratic state, and fascism, which we know all too well from debates in this Assembly over the past two years on warmongering and related subjects are liable to the most flagrant abuse and diverse interpretations.The statement of the Soviet delegate here tonight is a very good case in point on this. The Soviet amendment of article 22 introduces new elements into the article without improving the committed text and again introduces specific reference to discrimination. As was repeatedly pointed out in committee 3, the question of discrimination is comprehensively covered in article 2 of the Declaration, so that its restatement elsewhere is completely unnecessary and also has the effect of weakening the comprehensive principles stated in article 2. The new article proposed by the Soviet delegation is but a restatement of State obligation, which the Soviet delegation attempted to introduce into practically every article in the Declaration. It would convert the Declaration into a document stating obligations on states, thereby changing completely its character as a statement of principles to serve as a common standard of achievement for the members of the United Nations.The Soviet proposal for deferring consideration of the Declaration to the 4th session of the Assembly requires no comment. An identical text was rejected in committee 3 by a vote of 6 in favor and 26 against. We are all agreed, I am sure, that the Declaration, which has been worked on with such great effort and devotion, and over such a long period of time, must be approved by this Assembly at this session.Certain provisions of the Declaration are stated in such broad termsas to be acceptable only because of the provisions in article 30 providing for limitationon the exercise of the rights for the purpose of meeting the requirements of morality,public order, and the general welfare. An example of this is the provision that everyonehas the right to equal access to the public service in his country. The basic principle ofequality and of nondiscrimination as to public employment is sound, but it cannot beaccepted without limitation. My government, for example, would consider that this isunquestionably subject to limitation in the interest of public order and the generalwelfare. It would not consider that the exclusion from public employment of personsholding subversive political beliefs and not loyal to the basic principles and practicesof the constitution and laws of the country would in any way infringe upon this right.Likewise, my government has made it clear in the course of thedevelopment of the Declaration that it does not consider that the economic and social andcultural rights stated in the Declaration imply an obligation on governments to assure the enjoyment of these rights by direct governmental action. Thiswas made quite clear in the Human Rights Commission text of article 23 which served as aso-called umbrella article to the articles on economic and social rights. Weconsider that the principle has not been affected by the fact that this article no longercontains a reference to the articles which follow it. This in no way affects ourwhole-hearted support for the basic principles of economic, social, and cultural rightsset forth in these articles.In giving our approval to the Declaration today it is of primaryimportance that we keep clearly in mind the basic character of the document. It is not atreaty; it is not an international agreement. It is not and does not purport to be astatement of law or of legal obligation. It is a Declaration of basicprinciples of human rights and freedoms, to be stamped with the approval of the GeneralAssembly by formal vote of its members, and to serve as a common standard of achievementfor all peoples of all nations.We stand today at the threshold of a great event both in the life ofthe United Nations and in the life of mankind. This Universal Declaration of Human Rights may well become the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere. Wehope its proclamation by the General Assembly will be an event comparable to theproclamation of the Declaration of the Rights of Man by the French people in 1789, theadoption of the Bill of Rights by the people of the United States, and the adoption ofcomparable declarations at different times in other countries.At a time when there are so many issues on which we find itdifficult to reach a common basis of agreement, it is a significant fact that 58 stateshave found such a large measure of agreement in the complex field of human rights. Thismust be taken as testimony of our common aspiration first voiced in the Charter of theUnited Nations to lift men everywhere to a higher standard of life and to a greaterenjoyment of freedom. Man&#146;s desire for peace lies behind this Declaration. Therealization that the flagrant violation of human rights by Nazi and Fascist countriessowed the seeds of the last world war has supplied the impetus for the work which bringsus to the moment of achievement here today.In a recent speech in Canada, Gladstone Murray said:The central fact is that man isfundamentally a moral being, that thelight we have is imperfect does not matter so long as we are alwaystrying to improve it &#133; we are equal in sharing the moral freedomthatdistinguishes us as men. Man&#146;s status makes each individual an endinhimself. No man is by nature simply the servant of the state or ofanother man &#133; the ideal and fact of freedom -- and not technology -- are the true distinguishing marks of our civilization. This Declaration is based upon the spiritual fact that man must havefreedom in which to develop his full stature and through common effort to raise the levelof human dignity. We have much to do to fully achieve and to assure the rights set forthin this Declaration. But having them put before us with the moral backing of 58 nationswill be a great step forward.As we here bring to fruition our labors on this Declaration of HumanRights, we must at the same time rededicate ourselves to the unfinished task which liesbefore us. We can now move on with new courage and inspiration to the completion of aninternational covenant on human rights and of measures for the implementation of humanrights.In conclusion, I feel that I cannot do better than to repeat the callto action by Secretary Marshall in his opening statement to this Assembly: Let this third regular session of the General Assembly approve by anoverwhelming majority the Declaration of Human Rights as astandard of conduct for all; and let us, as Members of the UnitedNations, conscious of our own short-comings and imperfections, joinour effort in good faith to live up to this high standard.Book/CDs by Michael E.

I refer, of course, to the United States of America. But I am glad to come here -- and my wife and I and all of our party are glad to come here to South Africa, and we're glad to come to Cape Town. I am already greatly enjoying my stay and my visit here. I am making an effort to meet and exchange views with people of all walks of life, and all segments of South African opinion, including those who represent the views of the government.Today I am glad to meet with the National Union of South African Students. For a decade, NUSAS has stood and worked for the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- principles which embody the collective hopes of men of good will all around the globe. Your work at home and in international student affairs has brought great credit to yourselves and to your country. I know the National Student Association in the United States feels a particularly close relationship with this organization.And I wish to thank especially Mr. Ian Robertson, who first extended the invitation on behalf of NUSAS. I wish to thank him for his kindness to me in inviting me. I am very sorry that he can not be with us here this evening. I was happy to have had the opportunity to meet and speak with him earlier this evening. And I presented him with a copy of Profiles in Courage which was a book that was written by President John Kennedy and was signed to him by President Kennedy's widow, Mrs. John Kennedy.This is a Day of Affirmation, a celebration of liberty. We stand here in the name of freedom. At the heart of that Western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man, the child of God, is the touchstone of value, and all society, all groups and states exist for that person's benefit. Therefore, the enlargement of liberty for individual human beings must be the supreme goal and the abiding practice of any Western society.The first element of this individual liberty is the freedom of speech: the right to express and communicate ideas, to set oneself apart from the dumb beasts of field and forest; the right to recall governments to their duties and to their obligations; above all, the right to affirm one's membership and allegiance to the body politic -- to society -- to the men with whom we share our land, our heritage, and our children's future.Hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be heard, to share in the decisions of government which shape men's lives. Everything that makes man's life worthwhile -- family, work, education, a place to rear one's children and a place to rest one's head -- all this depends on the decisions of government; all can be swept away by a government which does not heed the demands of its people, and I mean all of its people. Therefore, the essential humanity of man can be protected and preserved only where government must answer -- not just to the wealthy, not just to those of a particular religion, not just to those of a particular race, but to all of the people.And even government by the consent of the governed, as in our own Constitution, must be limited in its power to act against its people, so that there may be no interference with the right to worship, but also no interference with the security of the home; no arbitrary imposition of pains or penalties on an ordinary citizen by officials high or low; no restriction on the freedom of men to seek education, or to seek work or opportunity of any kind, so that each man may become all that he is capable of becoming.These -- These are the sacred rights of Western society. These were the essential differences between us and Nazi Germany, as they were between Athens and Persia.They are the essence of our differences with communism today. I am unalterably opposed to communism because it exalts the State over the individual and over the family; and because its system contains a lack of freedom of speech, of protest, of religion, and of the press, which is characteristic of a totalitarian regime. The way of opposition to communism, however, is not to imitate its dictatorship, but to enlarge individual human freedoms. There are those in every land who would label as Communist every threat to their privilege. But may I say to you as I have seen on my travels in all sections of the world, reform is not communism. And the denial of freedom, in whatever name, only strengthens the very communism it claims to oppose.Many nations have set forth their own definitions and declarations of these principles. And there have often been wide and tragic gaps between promise and performance, ideal and reality. Yet the great ideals have constantly recalled us to our own duties. And with painful slowness, we in the United States have extended and enlarged the meaning and the practice of freedom to all of our people.For two centuries, my own country has struggled to overcome the self-imposed handicap of prejudice and discrimination based on nationality, on social class or race -- discrimination profoundly repugnant to the theory and to the command of our Constitution. Even as my father grew up in Boston, Massachusetts, signs told him: No Irish Need Apply. Two generations later President Kennedy became the first Irish Catholic, and the first Catholic, to head the nation; but how many men of ability had, before 1961, been denied the opportunity to contribute to the nation's progress because they were Catholic or because they were of Irish extraction? How many sons of Italian or Jewish or Polish parents slumbered in the slums -- untaught, unlearned, their potential lost forever to our nation and to the human race? Even today, what price will we pay before we have assured full opportunity to millions of Negro Americans?In the last five years we have done more to assure equality to our Negro citizens, and to help the deprived both white and black, than in the hundred years before that time. But much, much more remains to be done. For there are millions of Negroes untrained for the simplest of jobs, and thousands every day denied their full and equal rights under the law; and the violence of the disinherited, the insulted, the injured, looms over the streets of Harlem and of Watts and of the South Side Chicago.But a Negro American trains now as an astronaut, one of mankind's first explorers into outer space; another is the chief barrister of the United States government, and dozens sit on the benches of our court; and another, Dr. Martin Luther King, is the second man of African descent to win the Nobel Peace Prize2for his nonviolent efforts for social justice between all of the races.We have passed laws prohibiting -- We have passed laws prohibiting discrimination in education, in employment, in housing, but these laws alone cannot overcome the heritage of centuries -- of broken families and stunted children, and poverty and degradation and pain.So the road toward equality of freedom is not easy, and great cost and danger march alongside all of us. We are committed to peaceful and nonviolent change, and that is important to all to understand -- though  change is unsettling. Still, even in the turbulence of protest and struggle is greater hope for the future, as men learn to claim and achieve for themselves the rights formerly petitioned from others.And most important of all, all of the panoply of government power has been committed to the goal of equality before the law, as we are now committing ourselves to the achievement of equal opportunity in fact. We must recognize the full human equality of all of our people before God, before the law, and in the councils of government. We must do this, not because it is economically advantageous, although it is; not because the laws of God command it, although they do; not because people in other lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do.We recognize that there are problems and obstacles before the fulfillment of these ideals in the United States, as we recognize that other nations, in Latin America and in Asia and in Africa, have their own political, economic, and social problems, their unique barriers to the elimination of injustices.In some, there is concern that change will submerge the rights of a minority, particularly where that minority is of a different race than that of the majority. We in the United States believe in the protection of minorities; we recognize the contributions that they can make and the leadership that they can provide; and we do not believe that any people -- whether majority or minority, or individual human beings -- are expendable in the cause of theory or of policy. We recognize also that justice between men and nations is imperfect, and the humanity sometimes progresses very slowly indeed.All do not develop in the same manner and at the same pace. Nations, like men, often march to the beat of different drummers, and the precise solutions of the United States can neither be dictated nor transplanted to others -- and that is not our intention. What is important, however, is that all nations must march toward increasing freedom, toward justice for all, toward a society strong and flexible enough to meet the demands of all of its people -- whatever their race -- and the demands that the world of immense and dizzying change that face us all.In a few hours, the plane that brought me to this country crossed over oceans and countries which have been a crucible of human history. In minutes we traced migrations of men over thousands of years; seconds, the briefest glimpse, and we passed battlefields on which millions of men once struggled and died. We could see no national boundaries, no vast gulfs or high walls dividing people from people; only nature and the works of man -- homes and factories and farms -- everywhere reflecting Man's common effort to enrich his life. Everywhere new technology and communications brings men and nations closer together, the concerns of one inevitably becomes the concerns of all. And our new closeness is stripping away the false masks, the illusion of differences which is the root of injustice and of hate and of war. Only earthbound man still clings to the dark and poisoning superstition that his world is bounded by the nearest hill, his universe ends at river shore, his common humanity is enclosed in the tight circle of those who share his town or his views and the color of his skin.It is -- It is your job, the task of young people in this world, to strip the last remnants of that ancient, cruel belief from the civilization of man.Each nation has different obstacles and different goals, shaped by the vagaries of history and of experience. Yet as I talk to young people around the world, I am impressed not by the diversity but by the closeness of their goals, their desires and their concerns and their hope for the future. There is discrimination in New York, the racial inequality of apartheid in South Africa, and serfdom in the mountains of Peru. People starve to death in the streets of India; a formerPrime Minister is summarily executed in the Congo; intellectuals go to jail in Russia, and thousands are slaughtered in Indonesia; wealth is lavished on armaments everywhere in the world.These are different evils, but they are the common works of man. They reflect the imperfections of human justice, the inadequacy of human compassion, the defectiveness of our sensibility toward the sufferings of our fellows; they mark the limit of our ability to use knowledge for the well-being of our fellow human beings throughout the world. And therefore they call upon common qualities of conscience and indignation, a shared determination to wipe away the unnecessary sufferings of our fellow human beings at home and around the world.It is these qualities which make of our youth today the only true international community. More than this, I think that we could agree on what kind of a world we would all want to build. It would be a world of independent nations, moving toward international community, each of which protected and respected the basic human freedoms. It would be a world which demanded of each government that it accept its responsibility to insure social justice. It would be a world of constantly accelerating economic progress -- not material welfare as an end in/of itself, but as a means to liberate the capacity of every human being to pursue his talents and to pursue his hopes. It would, in short, be a world that we would all be proud to have built.Just to the north of here are lands of challenge and of opportunity, rich in natural resources -- land and minerals and people. Yet they are also lands confronted by the greatest odds -- overwhelming ignorance, internal tensions and strife, and great obstacles of climate and geography. Many of these nations, as colonies, were oppressed and were exploited. Yet they have not estranged themselves from the broad traditions of the West; they are hoping and they are gambling their progress and their stability on the chance that we will meet our responsibilities to them to help them overcome their poverty.In the world we would like to build, South Africa could play an outstanding role, and a role of leadership in that effort. This country is without question a preeminent repository of the wealth and the knowledge and the skill of this continent. Here are the greater part of Africa's research scientists and steel production, most of its reservoirs of coal and of electric power. Many South Africans have made major contributions to African technical development and world science. The names of some are known wherever men seek to eliminate the ravages of tropical disease and of pestilence. In your faculties and councils, here in this very audience, are hundreds and thousands of men and women who could transform the lives of millions for all time to come.But the help and the leadership of South Africa or of the United States cannot be accepted if we, within our own country or in our relationships with others, deny individual integrity, human dignity, and the common humanity of man. If we would lead outside our own borders, if we would help those who need our assistance, if we would meet our responsibilities to mankind, we must first, all of us, demolish the borders which history has erected between men within our own nations -- barriers of race and religion, social class and ignorance.Our answer is the world's hope: It is to rely on youth. The cruelties and the obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans. It cannot be moved by those who cling to a present which is already dying, who prefer the illusion of security to the excitement and danger which comes with even the most peaceful progress.This world demands the qualities of youth; not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the life of ease -- a man like the Chancellor of this University.It is a revolutionary world that we all live in, and thus, as I have said in Latin America and in Asia and in Europe and in my own country, the United States, it is the young people who must take the lead. Thus, you, and your young compatriots everywhere, have had thrust upon you a greater burden of responsibility than any generation that has ever lived.There is, saidan Italian philosopher, nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the -- in the introduction of a new order of things.3 Yet this is the measure of the task of your generation, and the road is strewn with many dangers.First, is the danger of futility: the belief there is nothing one man or one woman can do against the enormous array of the world's ills -- against misery, against ignorance, or injustice and violence. Yet many of the world's great movements, of thought and action, have flowed from the work of a single man. A young monk began the Protestant Reformation, a young general extended an empire from Macedonia to the borders of the earth, and a young woman reclaimed the territory of France. It was a young Italian explorer who discovered the New World, and 32 year-old Thomas Jefferson who proclaimed that all men are created equal.Give me a place to stand, said Archimedes, and I will move the world. These men moved the world, and so can we all. Few will have the greatness to bend history, but each of us can work to change a small portion of the events, and then the total -- all of these acts -- will be written in the history of this generation.Thousands of Peace Corps volunteers are making a difference in the isolated villages and the city slums of dozens of countries. Thousands of unknown men and women in Europe resisted the occupation of the Nazis and many died, but all added to the ultimate strength and freedom of their countries. It is from numberless diverse acts of courage such as these that the belief that human history is thus shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.If Athens shall appear great to you, said Pericles, consider then that her glories were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their duty. That is the source of all greatness in all societies, and it is the key to progress in our time.The second danger is that of expediency: of those who say that hopes and beliefs must bend before immediate necessities. Of course, if we must act effectively we must deal with the world as it is. We must get things done. But if there was one thing that President Kennedy stood for that touched the most profound feeling of young people around the world, it was the belief that idealism, high aspirations, and deep convictions are not incompatible with the most practical and efficient of programs -- that there is no basic inconsistency between ideals and realistic possibilities, no separation between the deepest desires of heart and of mind and the rational application of human effort to human problems. It is not realistic or hardheaded to solve problems and take action unguided by ultimate moral aims and values, although we all know some who claim that it is so. In my judgment, it is thoughtless folly. For it ignores the realities of human faith and of passion and of belief -- forces ultimately more powerful than all of the calculations of our economists or of our generals. Of course to adhere to standards, to idealism, to vision in the face of immediate dangers takes great courage and takes self-confidence. But we also know that only those who dare to fail greatly, can ever achieve greatly.It is this new idealism which is also, I believe, the common heritage of a generation which has learned that while efficiency can lead to the camps at Auschwitz, or the streets of Budapest, only the ideals of humanity and love can climb the hills of the Acropolis.And a third danger is timidity. Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change the world -- which yields most painfully to change. Aristotle tells us: At the Olympic games it is not the finest or the strongest men who are crowned, but those who enter the lists. So, too, in the life of the honorable and the good it is they who act rightly who win the prize.4 I believe that in this generation those with the courage to enter the conflict will find themselves with companions in every corner of the world.For the fortunate amongst us, the fourth danger, my friends, is comfort, the temptation to follow the easy and familiar paths of personal ambition and financial success so grandly spread before those who have the privilege of an education. But that is not the road history has marked out for us. There is a Chinese curse which says, May he live in interesting times. Like it or not we live in interesting times. They are times of danger and uncertainty; but they are also the most creative of any time in the history of mankind. And everyone here will ultimately be judged, will ultimately judge himself, on the effort he has contributed to building a new world society and the extent to which his ideals and goals have shaped that effort.So we part, I to my country and you to remain. We are, if a man of 40 can claim the privilege, fellow members of the world's largest younger generation. Each of us have our own work to do. I know at times you must feel very alone with your problems and with your difficulties. But I want to say how I -- impressed I am with the stand -- with what you stand for and for the effort that you are making; and I say this not just for myself, but men and women all over the world. And I hope you will often take heart from the knowledge that you are joined with your fellow young people in every land, they struggling with their problems and you with yours, but all joined in a common purpose; that, like the young people of my own country and of every country that I have visited, you are all in many ways more closely united to the brothers of your time than to the older generations in any of these nations. You're determined to build a better future. President Kennedy was speaking to the young people of America, but beyond them to young people everywhere, when he said: the energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it; and the glow from that fire can truly light the world. And, he added, With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.5I thank you.Book/CDs by Michael E. Eidenmuller, Published by McGraw-Hill (2008)1 This address -- along with John Kerry's Veterans Against the Vietnam War speech -- was added to the Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century index in May of 2014 to reflect accurately that liståÕs modification by its original authors.2Ralph Bunche, Ph.D. (1950), an African-American political theorist, an early and influential leader of the Civil Rights movement, and United Nations envoy in Palestine during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and Albert John Luthuli (1960) of South Africa, a Zulu Chieftain and devout lay minister in the Methodist faith tradition, were the first and second men of African descent -- indeed, the first individuals of color -- to win the Nobel Prize for Peace. Martin Luther King, Jr. was the third. 3 NiccolÌ_  Machiavelli, The Prince4Nicomachean Ethics, Book 1, Chapter 8. Kennedy takes some liberties with Aristotle's actual language (as translated into English) and not without axiological consequence. Aristotle places the emphasis on action per se, (...so those who act win, and rightly win, the noble and good things in life.) with the justification for winning following logically from the fact of merely committing to action. Kennedy places the moral qualifier rightly in conjunction with action, thereby suggesting that it is right action -- not merely action itself -- that justifies the victor. Three years earlier, John F. Kennedy used the same quotation, albeit more faithfully to the original, in hisVanderbilt Convocation Address.5John F.

",,,93,"John Kerry - Statement 1971 before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on VietnamJohn KerryStatement Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee1 delivered 22 April 1971, Washington, D.C.*Thank you very much,Senator Fulbright,Senator Javits,Senator Symington,Senator Pell.*I would like to say for the record that -- and also for the men behind me who are also wearing the uniform and their medals -- that my sitting up here is really symbolic. I'm not here as John Kerry. I'm here as one member of a group of 1000, which is a small representation of a very much larger group of veterans in this country. And were it possible for all of them to sit at this table, they would be here and have the same kind of testimony.I would simply like to speak in very general terms. I -- I apologize if my statement is general because I received notification yesterday you would hear me, and I'm afraid, because of the injunction, I was up most of the night and havenåÕt had a great deal of chance to prepare.I would like to talk representing of all those veterans and say that several months ago in Detroit we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged, and many very highly decorated, veterans testified to war crimes committed in Southeast Asia.*These were* not isolated incidents but crimes committed on a day-to-day basis with the full awareness of officers at all levels of command. It's impossible to describe to you exactly what did happen in Detroit -- the emotions in the room and the feelings of the men who were reliving their experiences in Vietnam. But they did. They relived the absolute horror of what this country, in a sense, made them do.They told the stories of times that they had personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages in the fashion reminiscent of Genghis Khan, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country.We call this investigation the Winter Soldier Investigation. The termWinter Soldier is a play on words of Thomas Paine's in 1776 when he spoke of the Sunshine Patriot and summertime soldiers who deserted at Valley Forge because the going was rough.And we who have come here to Washington have come here because we feel we have to be winter soldiers now. We could come back to this country; and we could be quiet; we could hold our silence; we could not tell what went on in Vietnam. But we feel because of what threatens this country, the fact that the crimes threaten it, not reds, not redcoats but the crimes which weåÕre committing are what threaten it; and we have to speak out.I would like to talk to you a little bit about what the result is of -- of the feelings these men carry with them after coming back from Vietnam. The country doesnåÕt know it yet but itåÕs created a monster, a monster in the form of millions of men who have been taught to deal and to trade in violence, and who are given the chance to die for the biggest nothing in history; men who have returned with a sense of anger and a sense of betrayal which no one has yet grasped.As a veteran, and one who feels this anger, IåÕd like to talk about it. WeåÕre angry because we feel we have been used in the worst fashion by the Administration of this country. In 1970 at West Point, Vice President Agnew said:Some glamorize the criminal misfits of society while our best men die in Asian rice paddies to preserve the freedoms which those misfits abuse.And this was used as a rallying point for our effort in Vietnam.But for us, his boys in Asia whom the country was supposed to support, his statement is a terrible distortion from which we can only draw a very deep sense of revulsion; and hence the anger of some of the men who are here in Washington today.ItåÕs a distortion because we in no way considered ourselves the best men of this country; because those he calls misfits were standing up for us in a way that nobody else in this country dared to; because so many who have died would have returned to this country to join the misfits in their efforts to ask for an immediate withdrawal from South Vietnam; because so many of those best men have returned as quadriplegics and amputees, and they lie forgotten in Veterans Administration hospitals in this country which fly the flag which so many have chosen as their own personal symbol. And we cannot consider ourselves AmericaåÕs best men when we were ashamed of and hated what we were called to do in Southeast Asia. In our opinion, and from our experience, there is nothing in South Vietnam, nothing which could happen that realistically threatens the United States of America. And to attempt to justify the loss of one American life in Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos by linking such loss to the preservation of freedom, which those misfits supposedly abuse, is to us the height of criminal hypocrisy, and itåÕs that kind of hypocrisy which we feel has torn this country apart.We are probably much more angry than that and I donåÕt want to go into the foreign policy aspects because IåÕm outclassed here. I know that all of you have talked about every possible -- every possible alternative to getting out of Vietnam. We understand that. We know that youåÕve considered the seriousness of the aspects to the utmost level and IåÕm not going to try and deal on that. But I want to relate to you the feeling which many of the men whoåÕve returned to this country express because we are probably angriest about all that we were told about Vietnam and about the mystical war against communism.We found that not only was it a civil war, an effort by a people who had for years been seeking their liberation from any colonial influence whatsoever, but also we found that the Vietnamese, whom we had enthusiastically molded after our own image, were hard put to take up the fight against the threat we were supposedly saving them from.We found that most people didnåÕt even know the difference between communism and democracy. They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace; and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Vietcong, North Vietnamese, or American.We found also that all too often American men were dying in those rice paddies for want of support from their allies. We saw first hand how monies from American taxes was used for a corrupt dictatorial regime. We saw that many people in this country had a one-sided idea of who was kept free by our flag, as blacks provided the highest percentage of casualties. We saw Vietnam ravaged equally by American bombs as well as by search and destroy missions, as well as by Vietcong terrorism; and yet we listened while this country tried to blame all of the havoc on the Vietcong.We rationalized destroying villages in order to save them. We saw America lose her sense of morality as she accepted very coolly a My Lai and refused to give up the image of American soldiers that hand out chocolate bars and chewing gum. We learned the meaning of free-fire zones, shoot anything that moves, and we watched while America placed a cheapness on the lives of Orientals. We watched the United States' falsification of body counts, in fact the glorification of body counts. We listened while month after month we were told the back of the enemy was about to break.We fought using weapons against åÒoriental human beings,åÓ with quotation marks around that. We fought using weapons against those people which I do not believe this country would dream of using were we fighting in a European theater -- or let us say a non-third-world people theater. And so we watched while men charged up hills because a general said That hill has to be taken. And after losing one platoon or two platoons they marched away to leave the hill for the reoccupation by the North Vietnamese; because -- because we watched pride allow the most unimportant of battles to be blown into extravaganzas; because we couldnåÕt lose, and we couldnåÕt retreat, and because it didnåÕt matter how many American bodies were lost to prove that point. And so there were Hamburger Hills and Khe Sahns and Hill 881's and Fire Base 6's and so many others.And now weåÕre told that the men who fought there must watch quietly while American lives are lost so that we can exercise the incredible arrogance of Vietnamizing the Vietnamese.Each day -- Each --Committee Chair (Sen. Fulbright): I hope you wonåÕt interrupt. HeåÕs making a very significant statement. And let him proceed.Mr. Kerry: Each day to facilitate the process by which the United States washes her hands of Vietnam, someone has to give up his life so that United States doesnåÕt have to admit something that the entire world already knows, so that we canåÕt say that weåÕve made a mistake. Someone has to die so that President Nixon wonåÕt be, and these are his words, åÒthe first President to lose a war.åÓ2And we are asking Americans to think about that because how do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake? But weåÕre trying to do that, and weåÕre doing it with thousands of rationalizations, and if you read carefully the PresidentåÕs last speech to the people of this country, you can see that he says, and says clearly:But the issue, gentlemen, the issue is communism, and the question is whether or not we will leave that country to the Communists or whether or not we will try to give it hope to be a free people.3But the point is theyåÕre not a free people now -- under us. TheyåÕre not a free people. And we cannot fight communism all over the world, and I think we should have learnt that lesson by now.But the problem of veterans goes beyond this personal problem, because you think about a poster in this country with a picture of Uncle Sam and the picture says åÒI want you.åÓ And a young man comes out of high school and says, åÒThatåÕs fine. IåÕm going to serve my country.åÓ And he goes to Vietnam and he shoots and he kills and he does his job or maybe he doesnåÕt kill, maybe he just goes and he comes back. When he gets back to this country he finds that he isnåÕt really wanted, because the largest unemployment figure in the country -- it varies depending on who you get it from, the Veterans Administration 15 percent, various other sources 22 percent -- but the largest figure of unemployed in this country are veterans of this war. And of those veterans 33 percent of the unemployed are black. That means 1 out of every 10 of the nationåÕs unemployed is a veteran of Vietnam.The hospitals across the country wonåÕt or canåÕt meet their demands. ItåÕs not a question of not trying. They havenåÕt got the appropriations. A man recently died after he had a tracheotomy in California, not because of the operation but because there werenåÕt enough personnel to clean the mucous out of his tube and he suffocated to death.Another young man just died in a New York VA hospital the other day. A friend of mine was lying in a bed two beds away and tried to help him, but he couldnåÕt. They rang a bell and there was no one there to service that man, and so he died of convulsions.Fifty-seven percent -- I understand 57 percent of all those entering VA hospitals talk about suicide. Some 27 percent have tried, and they try because they come back to this country and they have to face what they did in Vietnam, and then they come back and find the indifference of a country that doesnåÕt really care, that doesnåÕt really care.And suddenly we are faced with a very sickening situation in this country because thereåÕs no moral indignation, and if there is it comes from people who are almost exhausted by their past indignincies [sic], and I know that many of them are sitting in front of me. The country seems to have lied -- lain down and accepted something as serious as Laos, just as we calmly shrugged off the loss of 700,000 lives in Pakistan, the so-called greatest disaster of all times.But we are here as veterans to say that we think we are in the midst of the greatest disaster of all times now because they are still dying over there, and not just Americans, Vietnamese, and we are rationalizing leaving that country so that those people can go on killing each other for years to come.Americans seem to have accepted the idea that the war is winding down, at least for Americans, and they have also allowed the bodies, which were once used by a President for statistics to prove that we were winning this war, to be used as evidence against a man who followed orders and who interpreted those orders no differently than hundreds of other men in South Vietnam.We veterans can only look with amazement on the fact that this country has not been able to see that there's absolutely no difference between a ground troop and a helicopter crew. And yet, people have accepted the differentiation fed them by the Administration.No ground troops are in Laos, so it's alright to kill Laotians by remote control.But believe me, the helicopter crews fill the same body bags and they wreak the same kind of damage on the Vietnamese and Laotian countryside as anyone else, and the President is talking about allowing that to go on for many years to come.And one can only ask if we will really be satisfied when the troops march in to Hanoi.We are asking here in Washington for some action, action from the Congress of the United States of America which has the power to raise and maintain armies and which by the Constitution also has the power to declare war.We've come here, not to the President, because we believe that this body can be responsive to the will of the people; and we believe that the will of the people says that we should be out of Vietnam now.We're here in Washington also to say that the problem of this war is not just a question of war and diplomacy.It's part and parcel of everything that we are trying as human beings to communicate to people in this country:the question of racism, which is rampant in the military;and so many other questions also:the use of weapons;the hypocrisy in our taking umbrage in the...Geneva Conventions and using that as justification for continuation of this war, when we are more guilty than any other body of violations of those Geneva Conventions -- in the use of free-fire zones, harassment interdiction fire, search and destroy missions, the bombings, the torture of prisoners, the killing of prisoners -- accepted policy by many units in South Vietnam. That's what we're trying to say. It's part and parcel of everything. An American Indian friend of mine who lives on theIndian nation of Alcatraz put it to me very succinctly.He told me how as a boy on an Indian reservation he had watched television and he used to cheer the cowboys when they came in and shot the Indians. And then suddenly one day he stopped in Vietnam and he said, My God, I'm doing to these people the very same thing that was done to my people, -- and he stopped. And that's what we're trying to say, that we think this thing has to end.We're also here to ask -- We are here to ask and we're here to ask vehemently, Where are the leaders of our country?Where is the leadership? We're here to ask:Where areMcNamara,Rostow, Bundy4, Kilpatrick5, and so many others.Where are they now that we the men whom they sent off to war have returned?These are commanders who have deserted their troops and there is no more serious crime in the law of war.The Army says they never leave their wounded.The Marines say they never leave even their dead.These men have left all the casualties and retreated behind a pious shield of public rectitude.They've left the real stuff of their reputations, bleaching behind them in the sun in this country.And finally, this Administration has done us the ultimate dishonor.They've attempted to disown us and the sacrifices we made for this country.In their blindness and fear, they have tried to deny that we are veterans or that we served in Nam.We do not need their testimony.Our own scars and stumps of limbs are witness enough for others and for ourselves. We wish that a merciful God could wipe away our own memories of that service as easily as this Administration has wiped their memories of us.And all that they have done and all that they can do by this denial is to make more clear than ever our own determination to undertake one last mission:to search out and destroy the last vestige of this barbaric war, to pacify our own hearts, to conquer the hate and fear that have driven this country these last 10 years and more -- and more.And so, in 30 years from now our brothers go down the street without a leg, without an arm or a face, and small boys ask why, we will be able to say Vietnam and not mean a desert, not a filthy obscene memory but mean instead the place where America finally turned and where soldiers like us helped it in the turning.Thank you.*= content within asterisks absent from this audio and unverified as  delivered.
